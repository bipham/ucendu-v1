She cycled across Cambridge, avoiding tourists and students as she went, unable to share the happy atmosphere everyone else seemed to be enjoying. The river was alive with boats, the grass full of people picnicking. It was June and the time for end-of-term dances and university ceremonies.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Fanella envied the younger people.

We&#39;re both here this evening.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Then I&#39;ve got two mummies today,&#39; he said, and Fanella laughed.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I&#39;m not your mummy,&#39; said Fanella. &#39;I&#39;m your special grown-up friend.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Whose mummy are you?&#39; asked Timothy suddenly.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Nobody&#39;s,&#39; said Fanella, afraid the tears would start rolling down her cheeks again.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Why not?&#39; asked Timothy.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Well, not all grown-ups are somebody&#39;s mummy,&#39; began Fanella, feeling this whole subject was too much for her right now. &#39;Some grown-ups choose not to have children, and some grown-ups want to have children, but they can&#39;t.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Do you want to have children?&#39; asked Timothy.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Yes, I do, very much,&#39; said Fanella, thinking how strange it was that Timothy wanted to talk about this today of all days. &#39;Now it&#39;s time you went to sleep, and I&#39;m going to go and talk to your mummy.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Timothy put his arms up and Fanella leant over and kissed him on the cheek. Then he shut his eyes and began to breathe deeply. It was very pleasing, Fanella thought, when a little child trusted you enough to go to sleep in your presence.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">She went down the stairs and into the kitchen where Teresa was putting dishes into the dishwasher. Fanella thought Teresa was so lucky. She had this large beautiful house, a happy marriage and a lovely little boy. But because Teresa was such a good friend, it was difficult to feel envious.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Fanella&#39;s own home was quite different. She loved where it was, in a busy area of the city. There was an Asian grocer&#39;s nearby, selling all kinds of food, and a pub at the end of the road.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">But Fanella&#39;s house was tiny and she and Steven had done all the interior decoration themselves. In contrast to Teresa&#39;s soft shades of cream and natural wood, Fanella and Steven had gone a bit wild and had painted every room a bright colour, according to the mood they wanted to create. And always, in the back of Fanella&#39;s mind, had been the thought that one day, the little second bedroom would become her child&#39;s bedroom - the child she and Steven were going to adopt.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Sit down,&#39; said Teresa, waving a hand at the kitchen table. &#39;What would you like? Tea? Or something stronger?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Tea would be lovely,&#39; said Fanella. &#39;I haven&#39;t had a thing since I got back from work.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Have something to eat,&#39; said Teresa. &#39;There&#39;s some lasagne in the oven. Paulo&#39;s had to work late this evening. He just phoned to say he&#39;d get something to eat on the way home.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;No, thank you,&#39; said Fanella. &#39;I couldn&#39;t eat anything. Just tea, thanks.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;So,&#39; said Teresa sitting down beside her friend, &#39;what&#39;s happened?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Fanella took a deep breath. She wanted to tell Teresa the whole story without crying. But she could only manage two words. &#39;Steven&#39;s left,&#39; she said.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Left?&#39; Teresa was horrified.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Fanella looked at her friend, and nodded. She swallowed hard.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I can&#39;t believe it,&#39; said Teresa. &#39;You two were so much in love. You could see it. Everyone could see it. What do you mean he&#39;s left?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Left,&#39; repeated Fanella. &#39;He&#39;s moved out. He&#39;s gone to live in London. We&#39;ve finished. Broken up. It&#39;s over.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Teresa looked genuinely upset. &#39;What happened? When?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It&#39;s been going on for some time, actually,&#39; said Fanella, feeling relieved now she had told Teresa. &#39;He&#39;s been seeing another woman. I don&#39;t think he really loves her or anything, but we&#39;ve both been under so much stress with trying to adopt a child - I think he just cracked. This other woman was an escape route.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;My goodness!&#39; Teresa sat, not knowing what to say. This really had come as a shock to her. &#39;What... what about the adoption?&#39; she asked, at last.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It looks like that&#39;s out of the question now, doesn&#39;t it?&#39; said Fanella, holding her mug of tea tightly. &#39;The social services make it difficult enough to adopt a child when you&#39;re in a steady relationship. When they witness the relationship fall apart before their eyes, I expect they reject you immediately.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Teresa couldn&#39;t help thinking this was probably true. She tried to think of some words of comfort for her friend, but found it difficult to know what to say. &#39;Fanella,&#39; she sighed at last. &#39;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m truly sorry.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It&#39;s OK,&#39; said Fanella. &#39;I just needed to be with someone this evening.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;When did Steven leave?&#39; asked Teresa.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;This morning. He came back last night from her house and told me he was moving in with her,&#39; Fanella answered. </span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Didn&#39;t he give you any warning at all?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Well, actually I knew about the other woman,&#39; Fanella said. &#39;I&#39;ve known for a few weeks. He started staying in London more and more. I guessed something was going on and I asked him. He said he was trying to stop the affair. I really believed him. He said it was one of those things that was difficult to end because he didn&#39;t want to hurt her. She&#39;s younger. She&#39;s only twenty-one, not ready to settle down or anything, and she doesn&#39;t want children yet. It&#39;s strange because, like me, Steven wanted children so badly. We were so close to getting one.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Teresa looked at her friend and passed her a tissue. She knew all about the pain Fanella had gone through since she discovered she couldn&#39;t have her own children. Steven had been very understanding about it. He had moved in with Fanella and had lived with her for a few years before they decided to try to adopt a child.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Despite the difference in their lives, with Teresa now at home and Fanella still working at the publishers where they had met, the two women had remained close friends. Fanella and Steven had been very involved with Timothy ever since he was born. They had often looked after him, or taken him out at weekends. Fanella was never happier than when she was out with Steven and Timothy, imagining that one day it would be their own child who ran along between them. But now Fanella had to face the fact that the little second bedroom, reserved in her mind for the imaginary child, would probably remain empty forever.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Watching her friend, Teresa wanted to tell Fanella that there were other men out there. A lot of men found Fanella attractive. She was small, with a natural, country-girl face, short dark hair and dark brown eyes. She looked a little tired these days but that was hardly surprising, knowing what she&#39;d been going through.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">However, Teresa knew that Fanella did not want to hear this right now. Finding a man was one thing. Finding a man who was willing to accept that you could never have children, and who would support you through the difficult process of trying to adopt a child, was quite another. Steven had seemed perfect, but even he had weakened under the demands of the situation.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;The truth is,&#39; Fanella went on, &#39;I can bear to live without Steven, I think, once I get used to the idea, but I cannot bear the thought of living without a child.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Timothy is almost your child,&#39; Teresa said, putting her arm round her friend. &#39;He&#39;s always loved you. I sometimes feel he&#39;d rather have you for a mother than me!&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Fanella knew Teresa was trying her best, but it didn&#39;t soften the terrible pain of not having her own child.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I must go,&#39; said Fanella, hearing Paulo&#39;s key in the lock. She didn&#39;t want to spoil the little bit of evening Teresa and her husband had left together. &#39;Thanks for listening. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I just wish I could help,&#39; said Teresa sadly. &#39;Please come round any time you feel like it.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">As she watched Fanella cycle into the dusk, Teresa felt a little guilty at her own good fortune.</span></span></p>', 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0Byg9SrtGqyARVEp0MGNtc0RBY28&authuser=0', 1, '2017-09-14 16:05:49', '2017-09-14 16:05:49'),
(2, 1, 'After the summer', 0, 2, '<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod woke up to the sound of the alarm clock. It was a Tuesday morning in September. The first day back at school after the long summer break.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">He rolled over and looked at his beautiful wife. He admired her as she lay, still half asleep, on the white sheets beside him. It would be nice to stay in bed and spend the morning with her. But he had to be at school in time to prepare the day, before the children arrived at nine o&#39;clock.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">He rolled out of bed unwillingly and showered. Then, after pulling on the clothes he had put out the night before, he went down to the kitchen to make coffee. He would take Leah some coffee before he left, envying her being able to stay in bed in the mornings. She worked as a freelance interior designer and, unless she had an appointment somewhere, did not have to travel to work. She had a studio in the garage and operated her business from there.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod, on the other hand, had a forty-five-minute drive to the school in Cambridge where he worked. It was often a slow journey. The traffic seemed to get worse every day. But he and Leah loved their home in the country and, since he liked his job so much, the only option was to commute.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I&#39;ll see you this evening,&#39; he said, kissing his wife. She opened her eyes and smiled warmly.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;OK, have a good day,&#39; she said, as she turned over and went quickly back to sleep.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">An hour later, Rod was in his classroom and the children were arriving. You couldn&#39;t sit around for an hour in this job, catching up on phone calls, as you could in an office, Rod supposed. Children needed you then and there, and if you weren&#39;t prepared, the day could quickly turn into chaos.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Morning, Rod.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Hi, Teresa. Hello, Timothy.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod was Timothy&#39;s teacher, and Teresa was pleased. Rod was a good teacher and Timothy loved him. Rod was glad to have the little boy in his class and he liked Teresa; she was always friendly, and only ever had praise for the work he did.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Other parents were much more difficult. There was one mother who complained every morning about how her &#39;perfect little son&#39;, was being criticised by teachers and children alike. She could never see that her son might be to blame for anything. She even seemed to encourage him to start fights!</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod could see this mother coming now, and tried to avoid her by capturing Teresa&#39;s attention. &#39;There&#39;s something you might be able to help me with,&#39; he said to her. &#39;I want to invite someone in to talk about writing or illustrating children&#39;s books, or publishing them maybe. I thought it would be interesting for the children. I remember you used to work in publishing.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Ah,&#39; said Teresa. &#39;I know just the person.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Good,&#39; said Rod. &#39;Tell me more.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It&#39;s a friend of mine,&#39; Teresa said. &#39;She&#39;s an editor for children&#39;s books and has a lot of contact with authors and illustrators. But, more importantly, she knows about the whole publishing process... and she loves children. I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be delighted to come in and give a talk.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Do you want to ask her first?&#39; said Rod. &#39;If she&#39;s keen, she could telephone me at school.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;OK. That sounds like a good idea,&#39; said Teresa, kissing Timothy goodbye. &#39;She might be too busy of course, but I&#39;ll certainly ask her.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Thanks,&#39; said Rod, smiling at her. &#39;Right,&#39; he said turning to the class. &#39;Time to start the lesson.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">But the mother he had been trying to avoid was waiting for him. &#39;I want to talk to you about my Dan,&#39; she said, ignoring the fact that Rod was trying to calm down thirty children. &#39;Dan told me that last term a boy called Timothy kicked him.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Last term?&#39; Rod echoed. &#39;I really think that anything that happened over six weeks ago can be forgotten. We all want to make a new start at the beginning of the term, don&#39;t we?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;There you go again. You teachers always have your favourites, while children like my Dan get blamed for everything,&#39; the mother said.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I&#39;m not blaming Dan for anything,&#39; said Rod sighing, and wishing the woman would go. &#39;I just want to start the new term off on a positive note. I&#39;ll keep a careful eye on the two boys today, and let you know if there&#39;s any trouble.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod doubted that Timothy, who was such a quiet child, would have kicked Dan, who looked like a prizewinning boxer.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;You teachers. You just can&#39;t be bothered to do your jobs properly,&#39; said the woman insultingly. &#39;I&#39;ll be asking my Dan at the end of the day what happened, so you&#39;d better keep your word.&#39; She turned and left then, and Rod breathed a sigh of relief.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod enjoyed his job, and in contrast to the woman&#39;s accusations, he tried very hard to treat all the children fairly. But his job was made much more difficult when parents did not support him, and it always felt good when they did.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">By lunchtime, he was already exhausted. One child had been sick, and had been sent home. Dan had got into trouble in the break for stealing another child&#39;s apple, then throwing it over the school fence. Rod had had to send Dan to the headteacher. Rod was sure Dan&#39;s mother would hear about the incident and would soon be back to complain.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I need another holiday after this morning,&#39; he joked to the other teachers in the staffroom. Several of them looked at him pityingly. Rod was the only male teacher and some of the women clearly didn&#39;t think he was able to teach six-year-olds as well as they could. One or two of them also thought that because he had no children of his own, he was even less qualified for the job.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It&#39;s men, you see,&#39; joked one of them now. &#39;You&#39;re just not up to it.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod ignored her and went back to his classroom to prepare for the afternoon.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">By three o&#39;clock, as he read the class their afternoon story, they seemed much more settled. Looking at their small interested faces, he remembered what it was about the job he loved. However difficult they sometimes appeared, however awful their parents were, there was always some little ray of light in every child. Rod smiled to himself when he noticed that tough little Dan had his thumb in his mouth, as he listened to the story. Even Dan could be soft and sweet when he was tired and caught up in a good story, thought Rod.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod drove home, feeling the weight of the day lift from him as he left the city and set off across open country. His and Leah&#39;s home had been two cottages which they had made into one. With its views over open countryside and its stone floors and open fireplaces, it looked like something from a magazine. Leah had painted the walls white, stripped the paint off the wood and made her own curtains. Her antiques were carefully placed around the house, and everyone who came there admired it.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod liked the house too, but sometimes he couldn&#39;t help feeling it was maybe too elegant, too unlived in. He would be quite happy with a little more mess about the place. Leah placed high value on how things looked and for her the home was more important than anything. It was one of the reasons she didn&#39;t want children. She thought they would just mess it up and break her precious antiques.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">But it certainly was a peaceful place after a long noisy day in the classroom. Rod pulled his shoes off and placed them carefully by the door. He walked across the stone floor in the kitchen to the drinks cupboard and poured himself a beer.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Good day?&#39; Leah appeared in the doorway, her blonde hair slightly untidy from bending over the drawings on her desk.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Really busy,&#39; said Rod. &#39;How was yours?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Great,&#39; said Leah. &#39;I&#39;ve been asked to redecorate the Simpsons&#39; farmhouse up the hill. It&#39;s a big job and they&#39;ll pay well.&#39; </span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">She smiled. She loved her work and was beginning to get a name for herself in the world of interior design.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod admired her, and thought how different her days were to his. His day had involved dealing with a fight, a sick child, an anxious parent and a stressed headteacher, as well as trying to teach a group of children with hugely varying abilities. Meanwhile, his wife had done some drawings, visited a smart farmhouse and sat at her desk in the peace and quiet, looking beautiful. If he didn&#39;t love his job so much, he might envy her.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I&#39;ve made supper,&#39; said Leah, opening the oven door and letting a delicious smell float into the air.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Still, thought Rod, as he sat back on the sofa, there was nothing nicer than coming home to a wife who enjoyed her job, and managed to cook a nice meal at the same time.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It smells delicious,&#39; he said, pulling Leah down onto the sofa next to him. &#39;Mmm, and so do you. What perfume are you wearing?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It&#39;s Chanel,&#39; said Leah. &#39;A little treat for myself for getting that contract.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;You deserve it,&#39; said Rod, wondering when she&#39;d had time to go into town and buy herself perfume. He was also feeling annoyed with himself - he wished he&#39;d thought of buying it for her.</span></span></p>', 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0Byg9SrtGqyARZURYWlJiMzJiRUU&authuser=0', 1, '2017-09-14 16:12:26', '2017-09-14 16:12:26');

Anjana Abuja reports</i></p>\n\n<p><b>A.</b>&nbsp;Alan Macfarlane, professor of anthropological science at King&rsquo;s College, Cambride, has, like other historians, spent decades wrestling with the enigma of the Industrial Revolution. Why did this particular Big Bang &ndash; the world changing birth of industry &ndash; happen in Britain? And why did it strike at the end of the 18th century?</p>\n\n<p><b>B.</b>&nbsp;Macfarlane compares the puzzle to a combination lock. &lsquo;There are about 20 different factors and all of them need to be present before the revolution can happen,&rsquo; he says. For industry to take off, there needs to be the technology and power to drive factories, large urband populations to provide cheap labour, easy transport to move goods around, an affluent middle-class willing to buy mass-produces objects, a market-driven economy and a political system that allows this to happen. While this was the case for England, other nations, such as Japan, the Netherlands and France also met some oss these criteria but were not industrializing. &lsquo;All these factors must have been necessary but not sufficient to cause the revolution,&rsquo; says Macfarlane. &lsquo;After all, Holland had everything except coal, while China also had many of these factors. Most historians are convinced there are one or two missing factors that you need to open the lock.&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p><b>C.</b>&nbsp;The missing factors, he proposes, are to be found in almost every kitchen cupboard. Tea and beer two of the nation&rsquo;s favourite drinks, fueled the revolution. the antiseptic properties of tannin, the active ingredient in tea, and of hops in beer &ndash; plus the fact that both are made with boiled water &ndash; allowed urban communities to flourish at close quarters withous succumbing to water-borne diseases such as dysentery. The theory sounds eccentric but once he starts to explain the detective work that went into his deduction, the skepticism gives way to wary admiration. Macfarlane&rsquo;s case has been strengthened by support from notable quarters &ndash; Roy Porter, the distinguished medical historian, recently wrote a favourable appraisal of his research.</p>\n\n<p><b>D.&nbsp;</b>Macfarlane had wondered for a long time how the Industrial Revolution came about. Historians had alighted on one interesting factor around the mid-18th century that required explanation. Between about 1650 and 1740, the population in Britain was static. But then there was a burst in population growth. Macfarlane says: &lsquo;The infant mortality rate halved in the space of 20 years, and this happened in both rural areas and cities, and across all classes. People suggested four possible causes. Was there a sudden change in the viruses and bacteria around? Unlikely. Was there a change in environmental conditions? There were improvements in agriculture that wiped out malaria, but these were small grains. Sanitation did not become widespread until the 19th century. The only option left is food. But the height and weight statistics show a decline. So the food must have got worse. Efforts to explain this sudden reduction in child deaths appeared to draw a blank.&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>List of headings<br />\n<b>i.</b>&nbsp;The search for the reason for an increase in population<br />\n<b>ii.</b>&nbsp;The time and place of The Industrial Revolution<br />\n<b>iii.</b>&nbsp;The cases of Holland, France and China<br />\n<b>iv.</b>&nbsp;Comparisons with Japan lead to the answer<br />\n<b>v.</b>&nbsp;Two keys to Britain&rsquo;s Industrial Revolution<br />\n<b>vi.</b>&nbsp;Industrialization and the fear of unemployment<br />\nvii.&nbsp;Conditions required for Industrial Revolution</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b><i>C&Aacute;C BƯỚC L&Agrave;M B&Agrave;I CHI TIẾT:</i></b></p>\n\n<p><b>1.

Nowadays, ships&#39; cables are usually made from wire or synthetic fibres, but scientists are now suggesting that the cultivation of hemp should be revived for the production of paper and pulp.

They also point out that marijuana is less toxic than alcohol or tobacco. The other legalization movement is concerned only with the hemp plant used to produce fibre; this group wants to make it legal to cultivate the plant and sell the fibre for paper and pulp production. This second group has had a major triumph recently: in 1997, Canada legalized the farming of hemp for fibre.

As a result, 17% of its wealth went into transport costs. Some&nbsp;European and Asian cities, on the other hand, spent as little as 5%.

He describes it as two cities: &#39;A European city surrounded by a car-dependent one&#39;. Melbourne&#39;s large tram network has made car use in the inner city much&nbsp;lower, but the outer suburbs have the same car-based structure as most other Australian cities.&nbsp;The explosion in demand for accommodation in the inner suburbs of Melbourne suggests a&nbsp;recent change in many people&#39;s preferences as to where they live.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Newman says this is a new, broader way of considering public transport issues. In the past, the case for public transport has been made on the basis of environmental and social justice&nbsp;considerations rather than economics. Newman, however, believes the study demonstrates that&nbsp;&#39;the auto-dependent city model is inefficient and grossly inadequate in economic as well as&nbsp;environmental terms&#39;.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Bicycle use was not included in the study but Newman noted that the two most &#39;bicycle friendly&#39; cities considered - Amsterdam and Copenhagen - were very efficient, even though their public&nbsp;transport systems were &#39;reasonable but not special&#39;.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">It is common for supporters of road networks to reject the models of cities with good public transport by arguing that such systems would not work in their particular city. One objection is&nbsp;climate. Some people say their city could not make more use of public transport because it is&nbsp;either too hot or too cold. Newman rejects this, pointing out that public transport has been&nbsp;successful in both Toronto and Singapore and, in fact, he has checked the use of cars against&nbsp;climate and found &#39;zero correlation&#39;.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">When it comes to other physical features, road lobbies are on stronger ground. For example, Newman accepts it would be hard for a city as hilly as Auckland to develop a really good rail&nbsp;network. However, he points out that both Hong Kong and Zurich have managed to make a&nbsp;success of their rail systems, heavy and light respectively, though there are few cities in the&nbsp;world as hilly. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>A</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In fact, Newman believes the main reason for adopting one sort of transport over another is politics: &#39;The more democratic the process, the more public transport is favored.&#39; He considers&nbsp;Portland, Oregon, a perfect example of this. Some years ago, federal money was granted to&nbsp;build a new road. However, local pressure groups forced a referendum over whether to spend&nbsp;the money on light rail instead. The rail proposal won and the railway worked spectacularly well.&nbsp;In the years that have followed, more and more rail systems have been put in, dramatically&nbsp;changing the nature of the city. Newman notes that Portland has about the same population as&nbsp;Perth and had a similar population density at the time.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In the UK, travel times to work had been stable for at least six centuries, with people avoiding situations that required them to spend more than half an hour travelling to work. Trains and cars&nbsp;initially allowed people to live at greater distances without taking longer to reach their&nbsp;destination. However, public infrastructure did not keep pace with urban sprawl, causing&nbsp;massive congestion problems which now make commuting times far higher.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">There is a widespread belief that increasing wealth encourages people to live farther out where cars are the only viable transport. The example of European cities refutes that. They are<sup>-</sup>often&nbsp;wealthier than their American counterparts but have not generated the same level of car use. In&nbsp;Stockholm, car use has actually fallen in recent years as the city has become larger and&nbsp;wealthier. A new study makes this point even more starkly. Developing cities in Asia, such as&nbsp;Jakarta and Bangkok, make more use of the car than wealthy Asian cities such as Tokyo and&nbsp;Singapore. In cities that developed later, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank&nbsp;discouraged the building of public transport and people have been forced to rely on cars -creating the massive traffic jams that characterize those cities.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Newman believes one of the best studies on how cities built for cars might be converted to rail use is The Urban Village report, which used Melbourne as an example. It found that pushing&nbsp;everyone into the city centre was not the best approach. Instead, the proposal advocated the&nbsp;creation of urban villages at hundreds of sites, mostly around railway stations.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">It was once assumed that improvements in telecommunications would lead to more dispersal in the population as people were no longer forced into cities. However, the ISTP team&#39;s research&nbsp;demonstrates that the population and job density of cities rose or remained constant in the&nbsp;1980s after decades of decline. The explanation for this seems to be that it is valuable to place&nbsp;people working in related fields together. &#39;The new world will largely depend on human&nbsp;creativity, and creativity flourishes where people come together face-to-face.&#39;</span></span></span></p>\n', '<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:24px;\"><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>TEST 1</b></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt 440px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><br>\n<span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">A new study conducted for the World Bank by Murdoch University\'s Institute for Science and Technology Policy (ISTP) has demonstrated that public transport is more efficient than cars.

In cities that developed later, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank&nbsp;discouraged the building of public transport and people have been forced to rely on cars -creating the massive traffic jams that characterize those cities.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Newman believes one of the best studies on how cities built for cars might be converted to rail use is The Urban Village report, which used Melbourne as an example. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-4 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1502894130046\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"9\" id=\"hl-answer-9\">It found that pushing&nbsp;everyone into the city centre was not the best approach.

(4, 'Green Wave Washes Over Mainstream Shopping (changed)', '<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/storage/upload/images/green-shopping-cart1.jpg\" style=\"width: 347px; height: 346px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Research in Britain has shown that green consumers&#39; continue to flourish as a significant group amongst shoppers. This suggests that politicians who claim environmentalism is yesterday&#39;s issue may be seriously misjudging the public mood.</p>\n\n<p>A report from Mintel, the market research organisation, says that despite recession and financial pressures, more people than ever want to buy environmentally friendly products and a &#39;green wave&#39; has swept through consumerism, taking in people previously untouched by environmental concerns. The recently published report also predicts that the process will repeat itself with &#39;ethical&#39; concerns, involving issues such as fair trade with the Third World and the social record of businesses. Companies will have to be more honest and open in response to this mood.</p>\n\n<p>Mintel&#39;s survey, based on nearly 1,000 consumers, found that the proportion who look for green products and are prepared to pay more for them has climbed from 53 per cent in 1990 to around 60 per cent in 1994. On average, they will pay 13 per cent more for such products, although this percentage is higher among women, managerial and&nbsp;professional groups and those aged 35 to 44.</p>\n\n<p>Between 1990 and 1994 the proportion of consumers claiming to be unaware of or unconcerned about green issues fell from 18 to 10 per cent but the number of green spenders among older people and manual workers has risen substantially. Regions such as Scotland have also caught up with the south of England in their environmental concerns. According to Mintel, the image of green consumerism as associated in the past with the more eccentric members of society has virtually disappeared.

First, ATC extends over virtually the entire United States. In general, from 365m above the&nbsp;ground and higher, the entire country is blanketed by controlled airspace. In&nbsp;certain areas, mainly near airports, controlled airspace extends down to 215m&nbsp;above the ground, and, in the immediate vicinity of an airport, all the way down to&nbsp;the surface. Controlled airspace is that airspace in which FAA regulations apply.&nbsp;Elsewhere, in uncontrolled airspace, pilots are bound by fewer regulations. In this&nbsp;way, the recreational pilot who simply wishes to go flying for a while without all the&nbsp;restrictions imposed by the FAA has only to stay in uncontrolled airspace, below 365m, while the pilot who does want the protection afforded by ATC can easily&nbsp;enter the controlled airspace.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\"><b>F</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">The FAA then recognised two types of operating environments. In good meteorological conditions, flying would be permitted under Visual Flight Rules&nbsp;(VFR), which suggests a strong reliance on visual cues to maintain an acceptable&nbsp;level of safety. Poor visibility necessitated a set of Instrumental Flight Rules (IFR),&nbsp;under which the pilot relied on altitude and navigational information provided by the&nbsp;plane&rsquo;s instrument panel to fly safely. On a clear day, a pilot in controlled airspace&nbsp;can choose a VFR or IFR flight plan, and the FAA regulations were devised in a way&nbsp;which accommodates both VFR and IFR operations in the same airspace. However,&nbsp;a pilot can only choose to fly IFR if they possess an instrument rating which is&nbsp;above and beyond the basic pilot&rsquo;s license that must also be held.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\"><b>G</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">Controlled airspace is divided into several different types, designated by letters of the alphabet. Uncontrolled airspace is designated Class F, while controlled&nbsp;airspace below 5,490m above sea level and not in the vicinity of an airport is Class&nbsp;E. All airspace above 5,490m is designated Class A. The reason for the division&nbsp;of Class E and Class A airspace stems from the type of planes operating in them.&nbsp;Generally, Class E airspace is where one finds general aviation aircraft (few of&nbsp;which can climb above 5,490m anyway), and commercial turboprop aircraft. Above&nbsp;5,490m is the realm of the heavy jets, since jet engines operate more efficiently at&nbsp;higher altitudes. The difference between Class E and A airspace is that in Class&nbsp;A, all operations are IFR, and pilots must be instrument-rated, that is, skilled and&nbsp;licensed in aircraft instrumentation. This is because ATC control of the entire&nbsp;space is essential. Three other types of airspace, Classes D, C and B, govern the&nbsp;vicinity of airports. These correspond roughly to small municipal, medium-sized&nbsp;metropolitan and major metropolitan airports respectively, and encompass an&nbsp;increasingly rigorous set of regulations. For example, all a VFR pilot has to do to&nbsp;enter Class C airspace is establish two-way radio contact with ATC. No explicit&nbsp;permission from ATC to enter is needed, although the pilot must continue to obey all&nbsp;regulations governing VFR flight. To enter Class B airspace, such as on approach&nbsp;to a major metropolitan airport, an explicit ATC clearance is required. The private&nbsp;pilot who cruises without permission into this airspace risks losing their license.</span></span></span></p>', '\n                            <p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>TEST 2</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>A</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-1 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503284090561\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"44\" id=\"hl-answer-44\">An accident that occurred in the skies over the Grand Canyon in 1956 resulted in the establishment of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to regulate and&nbsp;oversee the operation of aircraft in the skies over the United States, which were&nbsp;becoming quite congested.</span> The resulting structure of air traffic control has greatly&nbsp;increased the safety of flight in the United States, and similar air traffic control&nbsp;procedures are also in place over much of the rest of the world.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Rudimentary air traffic control (ATC) existed well before the Grand Canyon disaster.

Before the dams were built, the Nile flowed freely, carrying huge quantities of sediment north from Africa&#39;s interior to be deposited on the Nile delta. This continued for 7,000 years, eventually covering a region of over 22,000 square kilometres with layers of fertile silt. Annual flooding brought in new, nutrient-rich soil to the delta region, replacing what had been washed away by the sea, and dispensing with the need for fertilizers in Egypt&#39;s richest food-growing area But when the Aswan dams were constructed in the 20th century to provide electricity and irrigation, and to protect the huge population centre of Cairo and its surrounding areas from annual flooding and drought, most of the sediment with its natural fertilizer accumulated up above the dam in the southern, upstream half of Lake Nasser, instead of passing down to the delta.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Now, however, there turns out to be more to the story It appears that the sediment-free water emerging from the Aswan dams picks up silt and land as it erodes the river bed and banks on the 800-kilometre trip to Cairo. Daniel Jean Stanley of the Smithsonian Institute noticed that water samples taken in Cairo, just before the river enters the delta, indicated that the river sometimes carries more than 850 grams of sediment per cubic metre of water - almost half of what it carried before the dams were built.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">&#39;I&#39;m ashamed to say that the significance of this didn&#39;t strike me until after I had read 50 or 60 studies,&#39; says Stanley in Marine Geology. &#39;There is still a lot of sediment coming into the delta, but virtually no sediment comes out into the Mediterranean to replenish the coastline. So this sediment must be trapped on the delta itself.&#39;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Once north of Cairo, most of the Nile water is diverted into more than 10,000 kilometres of irrigation canals and only o small proportion reaches the sea directly through the rivers in the delta. The water in the irrigation canals is still or very slow-moving and thus cannot carry sediment, Stanley explains.

Since that time the concentration of mercury has increased significantly. Lead from engines that use leaded fuels and from other industrial sources has also increased dramatically. These poisons can easily enter the food chain, affecting the productivity of fishing and farming. Another problem is that agricultural wastes include fertilizers which stimulate increases in plant growth in the lagoons and upset the ecology of the area, with serious effects on the fishing industry.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">According to Siegel, international environmental organisations are beginning to pay closer attention to the region, partly because of the problems of erosion and pollution of the Nile delta, but principally because they fear the impact this situation could have on the whole Mediterranean coastal ecosystem. But there are no easy solutions. In the immediate future, Stanley believes that one solution would be to make artificial floods to flush out the delta waterways, in the same way that natural floods did before the construction of the dams. He says, however, that in the long term an alternative process such as desalination may have to be used to increase the amount of water available. &#39;In my view, Egypt must devise a way to have more water running through the river and the delta/ says Stanley.

In the past, land scoured away from the coastline by the currents of the Mediterranean Sea used to be replaced by sediment brought down to the delta by the River Mile, but this is no longer happening.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Up to now, people have blamed this loss of delta land on the two large dams at Aswan in the south of Egypt, which hold back virtually all of the sediment that used to flow down the river. Before the dams were built, the Nile flowed freely, carrying huge quantities of sediment north from Africa\'s interior to be deposited on the Nile delta. This continued for 7,000 years, eventually covering a region of over 22,000 square kilometres with layers of fertile silt. Annual flooding brought in new, nutrient-rich soil to the delta region, replacing what had been washed away by the sea, and dispensing with the need for fertilizers in Egypt\'s richest food-growing area But when the Aswan dams were constructed in the 20th century to provide electricity and irrigation, and to protect the huge population centre of Cairo and its surrounding areas from annual flooding and drought, <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-1 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503286072432\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"49\" id=\"hl-answer-49\">most of the sediment with its natural fertilizer accumulated up above the dam in the southern, upstream half of Lake Nasser, instead of passing down to the delta.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Now, however, there turns out to be more to the story It appears that the sediment-free water emerging from the Aswan dams picks up silt and land as it erodes the river bed and banks on the 800-kilometre trip to Cairo. Daniel Jean Stanley of the Smithsonian Institute noticed that water samples taken in Cairo, just before the river enters the delta, indicated that the river sometimes carries more than 850 grams of sediment per cubic metre of water - almost half of what it carried before the dams were built.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">\'I\'m ashamed to say that the significance of this didn\'t strike me until after I had read 50 or 60 studies,\' says Stanley in Marine Geology. \'There is still a lot of sediment coming into the delta, but virtually no sediment comes out into the Mediterranean to replenish the coastline. So this sediment must be trapped on the delta itself.\'</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Once north of Cairo, most of the Nile water is diverted into more than 10,000 kilometres of irrigation canals and only o small proportion reaches the sea directly through the rivers in the delta. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-2 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503286083575\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"50\" id=\"hl-answer-50\">The water in the irrigation canals is still or very slow-moving and thus cannot carry sediment</span>, Stanley explains.

After all, music isn&#39;t necessary for getting through the day, and if it aids in reproduction, it does so only in highly indirect ways. Language, by contrast, is also everywhere - but for reasons that are more obvious. With language, you and the members of your tribe can organise a migration across Africa, build reed boats and cross the seas, and communicate at night even when you can&#39;t see each other.

In July, the journal Nature Neuroscience devoted a special issue to the topic. And in an article in the 6 August issue of the Journal of Neuroscience, David Schwartz, Catherine Howe, and Dale Purves of Duke University argued that the sounds of music and the sounds of language are intricately connected.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">To grasp the originality of this idea, it&#39;s necessary to realise two things about how music has traditionally been understood. First, musicologists have long emphasised that while each culture stamps a special identity onto its music, music itself has some universal qualities. For example, in virtually all cultures, sound is divided into some or all of the 12 intervals that make up the chromatic scale -that is, the scale represented by the keys on a piano. For centuries, observers have attributed this preference for certain combinations of tones to the mathematical properties of sound itself.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">Some 2,500 years ago, Pythagoras was the first to note a direct relationship between the harmoniousness of a tone combination and the physical dimensions of the object that produced it.

This link between simple ratios and harmony has influenced music theory ever since.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\"><b>Section C&nbsp;</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">This music-is-math idea is often accompanied by the notion that music, formally speaking at least, exists apart from the world in which it was created. Writing recently in The New York Review of Books, pianist and critic Charles Rosen discussed the long-standing notion that while painting and sculpture reproduce at least some aspects of the natural world, and writing describes thoughts and feelings we are all familiar with, music is entirely abstracted from the world in which we live. Neither idea is right, according to David Schwartz and his colleagues. Human musical preferences are fundamentally shaped not by elegant algorithms or ratios but by the messy sounds of real life, and of speech in particular &ndash; which in turn is shaped by our evolutionary heritage. &quot;The explanation of music, like the explanation of any product of the mind, must be rooted in biology, not in numbers per se,&quot; says Schwartz.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">Schwartz, Howe, and Purves analysed a vast selection of speech sounds from a variety of languages to reveal the underlying patterns common to all utterances. In order to focus only on the raw sounds, they discarded all theories about speech and meaning, and sliced sentences into random bites. Using a database of over 100,000 brief segments of speech, they noted which frequency had the greatest emphasis in each sound. The resulting set of frequencies, they discovered, corresponded closely to the chromatic scale. In short, the building blocks of music are to be found in speech.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">Far from being abstract, music presents a strange analogue to the patterns created by the sounds of speech. &quot;Music, like visual arts, is rooted in our experience of the natural world,&quot; says Schwartz. &quot;It emulates our sound environment in the way that visual arts emulate the visual environment.&quot; In music we hear the echo of our basic sound-making instrument - the vocal tract.

Alternately, it may be that music imitates the general products of the human sound-making system, which just happens to be mostly speech. &quot;We can&#39;t know this,&quot; says Schwartz. &quot;What we do know is that they both come from the same system, and it is this that shapes our preferences.&quot;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\"><b>Section D&nbsp;</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">Schwartz&#39;s study also casts light on the long-running question of whether animals understand or appreciate music.

If animals evolve preferences for sound as we do - based upon the soundscape in which they live - then their &quot;music&quot; would be fundamentally different from ours. In the same way our scales derive from human utterances, a cat&#39;s idea of a good tune would derive from yowls and meows. To demonstrate that animals don&#39;t appreciate sound the way we do, we&#39;d need evidence that they don&#39;t respond to &quot;music&quot; constructed from their own sound environment.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\"><b>Section E&nbsp;</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">No matter how the connection between language and music is parsed, what is apparent is that our sense of music, even our love for it, is as deeply rooted in our biology and in our brains as language is.

Regardless of what language they speak, the voice all mothers use with babies is the same: &quot;something between speech and song&quot;. This kind of communication &quot;puts the baby in a trancelike state, which may proceed to sleep or extended periods of rapture&quot;. So if the babies of the world could understand the latest research on language and music, they probably wouldn&#39;t be very surprised. The upshot, says Trehub, is that music may be even more of a necessity than we realise.</span></span></span></p>', '<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><strong>TEST 5</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\"><b>Section A</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">Music is one of the human species\' relatively few universal abilities. Without formal training, any individual, from Stone Age tribesman to suburban teenager, has the ability to recognise music and, in some fashion, to make it. Why this should be so is a mystery. After all, music isn\'t necessary for getting through the day, and if it aids in reproduction, it does so only in highly indirect ways. Language, by contrast, is also everywhere - but for reasons that are more obvious. With language, you and the members of your tribe can organise a migration across Africa, build reed boats and cross the seas, and communicate at night even when you can\'t see each other. Modern culture, in all its technological extravagance, springs directly from the human talent for manipulating symbols and syntax.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">Scientists have always been intrigued by the connection between music and language. Yet over the years, words and melody have acquired a vastly different status in the lab and the seminar room. While language has long been considered essential to unlocking the mechanisms of human intelligence, music is generally treated as an evolutionary frippery - mere \"auditory cheesecake\", as the Harvard cognitive scientist Steven Pinker puts it.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\"><b>Section B&nbsp;</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span new=\"\" roman=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">But thanks to a decade-long wave of neuroscience research, that tune is changing.

Countries ail across the world are actively promoting their &lsquo;wilderness&rsquo; regions - such as mountains, Arctic lands, deserts, small islands and wetlands - to high-spending tourists. The attraction of these areas is obvious.- by definition, wilderness tourism requires little or no initial investment. But that does not mean that there is no cost. As the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development recognized, these regions are fragile (i.e. highly vulnerable to abnormal pressures) not just in terms of their ecology, but also in terms of the culture of their inhabitants. The three most significant types of fragile environment in these respects, and also in terms of the proportion of the Earth&#39;s surface they cover, are deserts, mountains and Arctic areas. An important characteristic is their marked seasonality, with harsh conditions prevailing for many months each year. Consequently, most human activities, including tourism, are limited to quite clearly defined parts of the year.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Tourists are drawn to these regions by their natural landscape beauty and the unique cultures of their indigenous people. And poor governments in these isolated areas have welcomed the new breed of &lsquo;adventure tourist&rsquo;, grateful for the hard currency they bring. For several years now, tourism has been the prime source of foreign exchange in Nepal and Bhutan. Tourism is also a key element in the economies of Arctic zones such as Lapland and Alaska and in desert areas such as Ayers Rock in Australia and Arizona&rsquo;s Monument Valley.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B&nbsp;</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Once a location is established as a main tourist destination, the effects on the local community are profound. When hill-farmers, for example, can make more money in a few weeks working as porters for foreign trekkers than they can in a year working in their fields, it is not surprising that many of them give up their farm-work, which is thus left to other members of the family. In some hill-regions, this has led to a serious decline in farm output and a change in the local diet, because there is insufficient labour to maintain terraces and irrigation systems and tend to crops. The result has been that many people in these regions have turned to outside supplies of rice and other foods.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In Arctic and desert societies, year-round survival has traditionally depended on hunting animals and fish and collecting fruit over a relatively short season. However, as some inhabitants become Involved in tourism, they no longer have time to collect wild food; this has led to increasing dependence on bought food and stores. Tourism is not always the culprit behind such changes. All kinds of wage labour, or government handouts, tend to undermine traditional survival systems. Whatever the cause, the dilemma is always the same: what happens If these new, external sources of income dry up?</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The physical impact of visitors is another serious problem associated with the growth In adventure tourism. Much attention has focused on erosion along major trails, but perhaps more important are the deforestation and impacts on water supplies arising from the need to provide tourists with cooked food and hot showers. In both mountains and deserts, slow-growing trees are often the main sources of fuel and water supplies may be limited or vulnerable to degradation through heavy use.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Stories about the problems of tourism have become legion in the last few years. Yet it does not have to be a problem. Although tourism inevitably affects the region in which it takes place, the costs to these fragile environments and their local cultures can be minimized. Indeed, it can even be a vehicle for reinvigorating local cultures, as has happened with the Sherpas of Nepal&rsquo;s Khumbu Valley and in some Alpine villages. And a growing number of adventure tourism operators are trying to ensure that their activities benefit the local population and environment over the long term.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In the Swiss Alps, communities have decided that their future depends on integrating tourism more effectively with the local economy. Local concern about the rising number of second home developments in the Swiss Pays d&#39;Enhaut resulted in limits being imposed on their growth. There has also been a renaissance in communal cheese production In the area, providing the locals with a reliable source of income that does not depend on outside visitors.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Many of the Arctic tourist destinations have been exploited by outside companies, who employ transient workers and repatriate most of the profits to their home base. But some Arctic communities are now operating tour businesses themselves, thereby ensuring that the benefits accrue locally. For instance, a native corporation in Alaska, employing local people. Is running an air tour from Anchorage to Kotzebue, where tourists eat Arctic food, walk on the tundra and watch local musicians and dancers.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Native people In the desert regions of the American Southwest have followed similar strategies, encouraging tourists to visit their pueblos and reservations to purchase high-quality handicrafts and artwork. The Acoma and San lldefonso pueblos have established highly profitable pottery businesses, while the Navajo and Hopi groups have been similarly successful with jewellery.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Too many people living in fragile environments have lost control over their economies, their culture and their environment when tourism has penetrated their homelands. Merely restricting tourism cannot be the solution to the imbalance, because people&#39;s desire to see new places will not just disappear. Instead, communities in fragile environments must achieve greater control over tourism ventures in their regions, in order to balance their needs and aspirations with the demands of tourism. A growing number of communities are demonstrating that, with firm communal decision-making, this is possible. The critical question now is whether this can become the norm, rather than the exception.</span></span></span></p>\n', '<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>A</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The market for tourism In remote areas is booming as never before. Countries ail across the world are actively promoting their ‘wilderness’ regions - such as mountains, Arctic lands, deserts, small islands and wetlands - to high-spending tourists. The attraction of these areas is obvious.- by definition, wilderness tourism requires little or no initial investment. But that does not mean that there is no cost. As the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development recognized, <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-1 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503289890866\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"64\" id=\"hl-answer-64\">these regions are fragile</span> (i.e. highly vulnerable to abnormal pressures) not just in terms of their ecology, but also in terms of the culture of their inhabitants. The three most significant types of fragile environment in these respects, and also in terms of the proportion of the Earth\'s surface they cover, are deserts, mountains and Arctic areas. An important characteristic is their marked seasonality, with harsh conditions prevailing for many months each year. Consequently, most human activities, including tourism, are limited to quite clearly defined parts of the year.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Tourists are drawn to these regions by their natural landscape beauty and the unique cultures of their indigenous people. And poor governments in these isolated areas have welcomed the new breed of ‘adventure tourist’, grateful for the hard currency they bring. For several years now, tourism has been the prime source of foreign exchange in Nepal and Bhutan. Tourism is also a key element in the economies of Arctic zones such as Lapland and Alaska and in desert areas such as Ayers Rock in Australia and Arizona’s Monument Valley.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B&nbsp;</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Once a location is established as a main tourist destination, <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-2 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503289922080\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"65\" id=\"hl-answer-65\">the effects on the local community are profound</span>. When hill-farmers, for example, can make more money in a few weeks working as porters for foreign trekkers than they can in a year working in their fields, it is not surprising that many of them give up their farm-work, which is thus left to other members of the family. In some hill-regions, this has led to a <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-2 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503289937728\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"65\" id=\"hl-answer-65\">serious decline in farm output and a change in the local diet</span>, because there is insufficient labour to maintain terraces and irrigation systems and tend to crops. The result has been that <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-2 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503289959240\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"65\" id=\"hl-answer-65\">many people in these regions have turned to outside supplies of rice and other foods.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In Arctic and desert societies, year-round survival has traditionally depended on hunting animals and fish and collecting fruit over a relatively short season. However, as some inhabitants become Involved in tourism, <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-2 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503289971120\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"65\" id=\"hl-answer-65\">they no longer have time to collect wild food; this has led to increasing dependence on bought food and stores</span>. Tourism is not always the culprit behind such changes. All kinds of wage labour, or government handouts, tend to undermine traditional survival systems. Whatever the cause, the dilemma is always the same: what happens If these new, external sources of income dry up?</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The physical impact of visitors is another serious problem associated with the growth In adventure tourism. Much attention has focused on erosion along major trails, but perhaps more important are the deforestation and impacts on water supplies arising from the need to provide tourists with cooked food and hot showers. In both mountains and deserts, <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-2 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503289982745\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"65\" id=\"hl-answer-65\">slow-growing trees are often the main sources of fuel and water supplies may be limited or vulnerable to degradation through heavy use.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Stories about the problems of tourism have become legion in the last few years. Yet it does not have to be a problem. Although tourism inevitably affects the region in which it takes place, the costs to these fragile environments and their local cultures can be minimized. Indeed, it can even be a vehicle for reinvigorating local cultures, as has happened with the Sherpas of Nepal’s Khumbu Valley and in some Alpine villages. And a growing number of adventure tourism operators are trying to ensure that their activities benefit the local population and environment over the long term.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In the Swiss Alps, communities have decided that their future depends on integrating tourism more effectively with the local economy.

In the 21st century, the world&#39;s limited supply of renewable fresh water is having to meet demands of both larger total population and increased per capita consumption.

At present, average efficiency in the use of irrigated water in agriculture may be as low as 50%. Simple changes could improve the rate substantially, though it is unrealistic to expect very high levels of water-use efficiency in many developing countries, faced as they are with a chronic lack of capital and a largely untrained rural workforce. After agriculture, industry is the second biggest user of water and, in terms of value added per litre used, is sixty times more productive than agriculture. However, some industrial processes use vast amounts of water. For example, production of 1 kg of aluminium might require 1,500 litres of water. Paper production too is often very water-intensive. Though new processes have greatly reduced consumption, there is still plenty of room for big savings in industrial uses of water.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b><br />\nIn rich countries, water consumption has gradually been slowed down by price increases and the use of modern technology and recycling. In the USA, industrial production has risen fourfold since 1950, while water consumption has fallen by more than a third. Japan and Germany have similarly improved their use of water in manufacturing processes. Japanese industry, for example, now recycles more than 75% of process water. However, industrial water consumption is continuing to increase sharply in developing countries. With domestic and agricultural demands also increasing, the capacity of water supply systems is under growing strain.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b><br />\nMany experts believe that the best way to counter this trend is to impose water charges based on the real cost of supplies. This would provide a powerful incentive for consumers to introduce water-saving processes and recycling. Few governments charge realistic prices for water, especially to farmers. Even in rich California, farmers get water for less than a tenth of the cost of supply. In many developing countries there is virtually no charge for irrigation water, while energy prices are heavily subsidised too (which means that farmers can afford to run water pumps day and night). Water, which was once regarded as a free gift from heaven, is becoming a commodity which must be bought and sold on the open market just like oil. In the oil industry, the price increases which hit the market in the 1970s, coupled with concerns that supplies were running low, led to new energy conservation measures all over the world. It was realised that investing in new sources was a far more costly option than improving efficiency of use. A similar emphasis on conservation will be the best and cheapest option for bridging the gap between water supply and demand.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b><br />\nOne way to cut back on water consumption is simply to prevent leaks. It is estimated that in some of the biggest cities of the Third World, more than half of the water entering the system is lost through leaks in pipes, dripping taps and broken installations. Even in the UK, losses were estimated at 25% in the early 1990s because of the failure to maintain the antiquated water supply infrastructure. In addition, huge quantities of water are consumed because used water from sewage pipes, storm drains and factories is merely flushed away and discharged into rivers or the sea. The modern approach, however, is to see used water as a resource which can be put to good use - either in irrigation or, after careful treatment, as recycled domestic water. Israel, for instance, has spent heavily on used water treatment. Soon, treated, recycled water will account for most farm irrigation there. There are other examples in cities such as St Petersburg, Florida, where all municipal water is recycled back into domestic systems.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F</b><br />\nAnother way of conserving water resources involves better management of the environment generally. Interference with the ecosystem can have a severe effect on both local rainfall patterns and water run-off. Forest clearings associated with India&#39;s Kabini dam project reduced local rainfall by 25%, a phenomenon observed in various other parts of the world where large-scale deforestation has taken place. Grass and other vegetation acts as a sponge which absorbs rainfall both in the plants and in the ground. Removal of the vegetation means that rainfall runs off the top of the land, accelerating erosion instead of being gradually fed into the soil to renew ground water.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>G</b><br />\nGlobal warming is bound to affect rainfall patterns, though there is considerable disagreement about its precise effects. But it is likely that, as sea levels rise, countries in low-lying coastal areas will be hit by seawater penetration of ground water. Other countries will experience changes in rainfall which could have a major impact on agricultural yield - either for better or for worse. In broad terms, it is thought that rainfall zones will shift northwards, adding to the water deficit in Africa, the Middle East and the Mediterranean - a grim prospect indeed.</span></span></span></p>\n', '<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Test Mode 1</strong></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><i>Greater efficiency in water use is needed to meet the growing demands of a changing world</i></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>A</b><br>\nPer capita water usage has been on an upward trend for many years.

A similar emphasis on conservation will be the best and cheapest option for bridging the gap between water supply and demand.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b><br>\nOne way to cut back on water consumption is simply to prevent leaks. It is estimated that in some of the biggest cities of the Third World, more than half of the water entering the system is lost through leaks in pipes, dripping taps and broken installations. Even in the UK, losses were estimated at 25% in the early 1990s because of the failure to maintain the antiquated water supply infrastructure. In addition, huge quantities of water are consumed because used water from sewage pipes, storm drains and factories is merely flushed away and discharged into rivers or the sea. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-5 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503304078075\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"73\" id=\"hl-answer-73\">The modern approach, however, is to see used water as a resource which can be put to good use - either in irrigation or, after careful treatment, as recycled domestic water.</span> Israel, for instance, has spent heavily on used water treatment. Soon, treated, recycled water will account for most farm irrigation there. There are other examples in cities such as St Petersburg, Florida, where all municipal water is recycled back into domestic systems.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F</b><br>\n<span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-6 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503304092739\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"74\" id=\"hl-answer-74\">Another way of conserving water resources involves better management of the environment generally. Interference with the ecosystem can have a severe effect on both local rainfall patterns and water run-off</span>. Forest clearings associated with India\'s Kabini dam project reduced local rainfall by 25%, a phenomenon observed in various other parts of the world where large-scale deforestation has taken place. Grass and other vegetation acts as a sponge which absorbs rainfall both in the plants and in the ground. Removal of the vegetation means that rainfall runs off the top of the land, accelerating erosion instead of being gradually fed into the soil to renew ground water.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>G</b><br>\nGlobal warming is bound to affect rainfall patterns, though there is considerable disagreement about its precise effects. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-7 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503303993356\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"75\" id=\"hl-answer-75\">But it is likely that, as sea levels rise, countries in low-lying coastal areas will be hit by seawater penetration of ground water</span>. Other countries will experience changes in rainfall which could have a major impact on agricultural yield - either for better or for worse. In broad terms, it is thought that rainfall zones will shift northwards, adding to the water deficit in Africa, the Middle East and the Mediterranean - a grim prospect indeed.</span></span></span></p>\n', 'test mode 1 matching heading.png', 1, '2017-08-21 15:28:16', '2017-08-21 15:28:16');

Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical transport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices, the requirement for transport continues to increase. There are two key factors behind this trend. For passenger transport, the determining factor is the spectacular growth in car use. The number of cars on European Union (EU) roads saw an increase of three million cars each year from 1990 to 2010, and in the next decade the EU will see a further substantial increase in its fleet.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B</b>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">As far as goods transport is concerned, growth is due to a large extent to changes in the European economy and its system of production. In the last 20 years, as internal frontiers have been abolished, the EU has moved from a &rdquo;stock&rdquo;&nbsp;economy to a &rdquo;flow&rdquo; economy. This phenomenon has been emphasised by the relocation of some industries, particularly those which are labour intensive, to reduce production costs, even though the production site is hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the final assembly plant or away from users.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The strong economic growth expected in countries which are candidates for entry to the EU will also increase transport flows, in particular road haulage traffic. In 1998, some of these countries already exported more than twice their 1990 volumes and imported more than five times their 1990 volumes. And although many candidate countries inherited a transport system which encourages rail, the distribution between modes has tipped sharply in favour of road transport since the 1990s. Between 1990 and 1998<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">，</span>road haulage increased by 19.4%, while during the same period rail haulage decreased by 43.5%, although &ndash; and this could benefit the enlarged EU &ndash; it is still on average at a much higher level than in existing member states.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D&nbsp;</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">However, a new imperative-sustainable development &ndash; offers an opportunity for adapting the EU<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">，</span>s common transport policy. This objective, agreed by the Gothenburg European Council, has to be achieved by integrating environmental considerations into Community policies, and shifting the balance between modes of transport lies at the heart of its strategy. The ambitious objective can only be fully achieved by 2020, but proposed measures are nonetheless a first essential step towards a sustainable transport system which will ideally be in place in 30 years‟ time, that is by 2040.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In 1998, energy consumption in the transport sector was to blame for 28% of emissions of CO2<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">，</span>the leading greenhouse gas. According to the latest estimates, if nothing is done to reverse the traffic growth trend, CO2 emissions from transport can be expected to increase by around 50% to 1,113 billion tonnes by 2020<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">，</span>compared with the 739 billion tonnes recorded in 1990. Once again, road&nbsp;transport is the main culprit since it alone accounts for 84% of the CO2 emissions attributable to transport. Using alternative fuels and improving energy efficiency is thus both an ecological necessity and a technological challenge.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F</b>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">At the same time greater efforts must be made to achieve a modal shift. Such a change cannot be achieved overnight, all the less so after over half a century of constant deterioration in favour of road. This has reached such a pitch that today rail freight services are facing marginalisation, with just 8% of market share, and with international goods trains struggling along at an average speed of 18km/h.

The sauropodomorphs, or &quot;lizard feet forms&quot;, included both bipedal and quadrupedal dinosaurs. Some sauropodomorphs were carnivorous or omnivorous but later species were typically herbivorous.

By contrast, in ornithischian, or bird-hipped, dinosaurs, the pubis points backwards towards the rear of the animal, which is also true of birds.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;<span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-6 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503325684989\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"105\" id=\"hl-answer-105\">Of the two orders of dinosaurs, the Saurischia was the larger and the first to evolve</span>. It is divided into two suborders: Therapoda, or therapods, and Sauropodomorpha, or sauropodomorphs. The therapods, or \"beast feet\", were bipedal, predatory carnivores. They ranged in size from the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex, 12m long, 5.6m tall and weighing an estimated 6.4 tonnes, to the smallest known dinosaur, Compsognathus, a mere 1.4m long and estimated 3kg in weight when fully grown. The sauropodomorphs, or \"lizard feet forms\", included both bipedal and quadrupedal dinosaurs. Some sauropodomorphs were carnivorous or omnivorous but later species were typically herbivorous. They included some of the largest and best-known of all dinosaurs, such as Diplodocus, a huge quadruped with an elephant-like body, a long, thin tail and neck that gave it a total length of 27m, and a tiny head.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>G.</b>&nbsp; <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-7 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503325698334\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"106\" id=\"hl-answer-106\">Ornithischian dinosaurs&nbsp; were bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores. They are now usually divided into three suborders: Ornithipoda, Thyreophora and Marginocephalia. </span>The ornithopods, or \"bird feet\", both large and small, could walk or run on their long hind legs, balancing their body by holding their tails stiffly off the ground behind them. An example is Iguanodon, up to 9m long, 5m tall and weighing 4.5 tonnes. The thyreophorans, or \"shield bearers\", also known as armoured dinosaurs, were quadrupeds with rows of protective bony spikes, studs, or plates along their backs and tails. They included Stegosaurus, 9m long and weighing 2 tonnes.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>H.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;The marginocephalians, or \"margined heads\", were bipedal or quadrupedal ornithschians with a deep bony frill or narrow shelf at the back of the skull.

They based their calendars on three natural cycles: the&nbsp;solar day, marked by the successive periods of light and darkness as the earth rotates on&nbsp;its axis; the lunar month, following the phases of the moon as it orbits the earth; and&nbsp;the solar year, defined by the changing seasons that accompany our planet&#39;s revolution&nbsp;around the sun.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Before the invention of artificial light, the moon had greater social impact. And, for those living near the equator in particular, its waxing and waning was more conspicuous than&nbsp;the passing of the seasons. Hence, the calendars that were developed at the lower latitudes&nbsp;were influenced more by the lunar cycle than by the solar year. In more northern climes,&nbsp;however, where seasonal agriculture was practised, the solar year became more crucial. As&nbsp;the Roman Empire expanded northward, it organised its activity chart for the most part&nbsp;around the solar year.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Centuries before the Roman Empire, the Egyptians had formulated a municipal calendar having 12 months of 30 days, with five days added to approximate the solar year. Each&nbsp;period of ten days was marked by the appearance of special groups of stars called decans.&nbsp;At the rise of the star Sirius just before sunrise, which occurred around the all-important&nbsp;annual flooding of the Nile, 12 decans could be seen spanning the heavens. The cosmic&nbsp;significance the Egyptians placed in the 12 decans led them to develop a system in which&nbsp;each interval of darkness (and later, each interval of daylight) was divided into a dozen&nbsp;equal parts. These periods became known as temporal hours because their duration varied&nbsp;according to the changing length of days and nights with the passing of the seasons.&nbsp;Summer hours were long, winter ones short; only at the spring and autumn equinoxes&nbsp;were the hours of daylight and darkness equal. Temporal hours, which were first adopted by the Greeks and then the Romans, who disseminated them through Europe, remained&nbsp;in use for more than 2,500 years.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In order to track temporal hours during the day, inventors created sundials, which indicate time by the length or direction of the sun&#39;s shadow. The sundial&#39;s counterpart, the water&nbsp;clock, was designed to measure temporal hours at night. One of the first water clocks&nbsp;was a basin with a small hole near the bottom through which the water dripped out. The&nbsp;falling water level denoted the passing hour as it dipped below hour lines inscribed on the&nbsp;inner surface.

They based their calendars on three natural cycles: the&nbsp;solar day, marked by the successive periods of light and darkness as the earth rotates on&nbsp;its axis; the lunar month, following the phases of the moon as it orbits the earth; and&nbsp;the solar year, defined by the changing seasons that accompany our planet\'s revolution&nbsp;around the sun.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Before the invention of artificial light, the moon had greater social impact. And, for those living near the equator in particular, its waxing and waning was more conspicuous than&nbsp;the passing of the seasons. Hence, the calendars that were developed at the lower latitudes&nbsp;were influenced more by the lunar cycle than by the solar year. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-2 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503328263292\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"115\" id=\"hl-answer-115\">In more northern climes,&nbsp;however, where seasonal agriculture was practised, the solar year became more crucial</span>. As&nbsp;the Roman Empire expanded northward, it organised its activity chart for the most part&nbsp;around the solar year.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Centuries before the Roman Empire, the Egyptians had formulated a municipal calendar having 12 months of 30 days, with five days added to approximate the solar year. Each&nbsp;period of ten days was marked by the appearance of special groups of stars called decans.&nbsp;At the rise of the star Sirius just before sunrise, which occurred around the all-important&nbsp;annual flooding of the Nile, 12 decans could be seen spanning the heavens. The cosmic&nbsp;significance the Egyptians placed in the 12 decans led them to develop a system in which&nbsp;each interval of darkness (and later, each interval of daylight) was divided into a dozen&nbsp;equal parts. These periods became known as temporal hours because their duration varied&nbsp;according to the changing length of days and nights with the passing of the seasons.&nbsp;Summer hours were long, winter ones short; only at the spring and autumn equinoxes&nbsp;were the hours of daylight and darkness equal. Temporal hours, which were first adopted by the Greeks and then the Romans, who disseminated them through Europe, remained&nbsp;in use for more than 2,500 years.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In order to track temporal hours during the day, inventors created sundials, which indicate time by the length or direction of the sun\'s shadow. The sundial\'s counterpart, the water&nbsp;clock, was designed to measure temporal hours at night. One of the first water clocks&nbsp;was a basin with a small hole near the bottom through which the water dripped out.

It comes in a wide variety of forms, ranging in heightfrom 30 centimeters to more than 40 meters. It is also the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing woody plant; some species can grow more than a meterin a day. Bamboo&rsquo;s ecological rote extends beyond providing food and habitat for animals. Bamboo tends to grow in stands made up of groups of individual plants that grow from root systems known as rhizomes. Its extensive rhizome systems, which tie in the top layers of the soil, are crucial in preventing soil erosion. And there is growing evidence that bamboo plays an important part in determining forest structure and dynamics. &ldquo;Bamboo&rsquo;s pattern of mass flowering and mass death leaves behind large areas of dry biomass that attract wildfire,&rdquo; says Kapos. &ldquo;When these burn, they create patches of open ground within the forest far bigger than would be left by a fallen tree.&rdquo;Patchiness helps to preserve diversity because certain plant species do better during the early stages of regeneration when there are gaps in the canopy.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">However, bamboo&rsquo;s most immediate significance lies in its economic value. Modern processing techniques mean that it can be used in a variety of ways, for example, as flooring and laminates. One of the fastest growing bamboo products&nbsp; is&nbsp; paper-25&nbsp; percent&nbsp; of&nbsp; paper&nbsp; produced&nbsp; in&nbsp; India&nbsp; is&nbsp; made&nbsp; from bamboo fiber, and in Brazil, 100,000 hectares of bamboo are grown for its production. Of course, bamboo&rsquo;s main function has always been in domestic applications, and as a locally traded commodity it&rsquo;s worth about $4.5billion annually. Because of its versatility, flexibility and strength (its tensile strength compares to that of some steel), it has traditionally been used in construction. Today, more than one billion people worldwide live in bamboo houses. Bamboo is often the only readily available raw material for people in many developing countries, says Chris Stapleton, a research associate at the Royal Botanic Gardens. &ldquo;Bamboo can be harvested from forest areas or grown quickly elsewhere, and then converted simply without expensive machinery or facilities,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In this way, it contributes substantially to poverty alleviation and wealth creation.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Given bamboo&rsquo;s value in economic and ecological terms, the picture paintedby theUNEP report is all the more worrying. But keen horticulturists will spot an apparent contradiction here. Those who&rsquo;ve followed the recent vogue for cultivating exotic species in their gardens will point out that if it isn&rsquo;t kept in check, bamboo can cause real problems. &ldquo;In a lot of places, the people who live with bamboo don&rsquo;t perceive it as being endangered in any way,&rdquo; says Kapos. &ldquo;In fact, a lot of bamboo species are actually very invasive if they&rsquo;ve been introduced.&rdquo;So why are so many species endangered? There are two separate issues here, says Ray Townsend, vice president of the British Bamboo Society and arboretum manager at the Royal Botanic Gardens. &ldquo;Some plants are threatened because they can&rsquo;t survive in the habitat-they aren&rsquo;t strong enough or there aren&rsquo;t enough of them, perhaps. But bamboo can take care of itself-it is strong enough to survive if left alone. What is under threat is its habitat.&rdquo;It is the physical disturbance that is the threat to bamboo, says Kapos. &ldquo;When forest goes, it is converted into something else: there isn&rsquo;t anywhere for forest plants such as bamboo to grow if you create a cattle pasture.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F&nbsp;</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Around the world, bamboo species are routinely protected as part of foresteco-systems in national parks and reserves, but there is next to nothing that protects bamboo in the wild for its own sake. However, some small steps are being taken to address this situation. The UNEP-INBAR report will help conservationists to establish effective measures aimed at protecting valuable wild bamboo species. Towns end, too, sees the UNEP report as an important step forward in promoting the cause of bamboo conservation. &ldquo;Until now, bamboo has been perceived as a second-class plant. When you talk about places such as the Amazon, everyone always thinks about the hardwoods. Of course these are significant, but there is a tendency to overlook the plants they are associated with, which are often bamboo species. In many ways, it is the most important plant known to man. I can&rsquo;t think of another plant that is used so much and is so commercially important in so many countries.&rdquo;He believes that the most important first step is to get scientists into the field. &ldquo;We need to go out there, look at these plants and see how they survive and then use that information to conserve them for the future.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>\n', '<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Test 2&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><i>The wonder plant with an uncertain future: more than a billion people rely on bamboo for either their shelter or income, while many endangered species depend on it for their survival.

Bamboo’s ecological rote extends beyond providing food and habitat for animals. Bamboo tends to grow in stands made up of groups of individual plants that grow from root systems known as rhizomes. Its extensive rhizome systems, which tie in the top layers of the soil, are crucial in preventing soil erosion. And there is growing evidence that bamboo plays an important part in determining forest structure and dynamics. “Bamboo’s pattern of mass flowering and mass death leaves behind large areas of dry biomass that attract wildfire,” says Kapos. “When these burn, they create patches of open ground within the forest far bigger than would be left by a fallen tree.”Patchiness helps to preserve diversity because certain plant species do better during the early stages of regeneration when there are gaps in the canopy.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">However, bamboo’s most immediate significance lies in its economic value.

Researchers claim that the human personality is formed during the first two years of life, and during the first three years children learn the basic skills they will use in all their later learning both at home and at school. Once over the age of three, children continue to expand on existing knowledge of the world.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">It is generally acknowledged that young people from poorer socio-economic backgrounds fend to do less well in our education system. That&#39;s observed not just in New Zealand, but also in Australia, Britain and America. In an attempt to overcome that educational under-achievement, a nationwide programme called &#39;Headstart&#39; was launched in the United Slates in 1965. A lot of money was poured into it. It took children into pre-school institutions at the age of three and was supposed to help the children of poorer families succeed in school.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Despite substantial funding, results have been disappointing. It is thought that there are two explanations for this. First, the programme began too late. Many children who entered it at the age of three were already behind their peers in language and measurable intelligence. Second, the parents were not involved. At the end of each day, &#39;Headstart&#39; children returned to the same disadvantaged home environment.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">As a result of the growing research evidence of the importance of the first three years of a child&#39;s life and the disappointing results from &#39;Headstart&#39;, a pilot programme was launched in Missouri in the US that focused on parents as the child&#39;s first teachers. The &#39;Missouri&#39; programme was predicated on research showing that working with the family, rather than bypassing the parents, is the most effective way of helping children get off to the best possible start in life. The four-year pilot study included 380 families who were about to have their first child and who represented a cross-section of socio-economic status, age and family configurations. They included single-parent and two-parent families, families in which both parents worked, and families with either the mother or father at home.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The programme involved trained parent- educators visiting the parents&#39; home and working with tire parent, or parents, and the child. Information on child development, and guidance on things to look for and expect as the child grows were provided, plus guidance in fostering the child&#39;s intellectual, language, social and motor-skill development. Periodic check-ups of the child&#39;s educational and sensory development (hearing and vision) were made to detect possible handicaps that interfere with growth and development. Medical problems were referred to professionals.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Parent-educators made personal visits to homes and monthly group meetings were held with other new parents to share experience and discuss topics of interest. Parent resource centres, located in school buildings, offered learning materials for families and facilitators for child core.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">At the age of three, the children who had been involved in the &#39;Missouri&#39; programme were evaluated alongside a cross-section of children selected from the same range of socio-economic backgrounds and family situations, and also a random sample of children that age. The results were phenomenal. By the age of three, the children in the programme were significantly more advanced in language development than their peers, had made greater strides in problem solving and other intellectual skills, and were further along in social development, tn fact, the average child on the programme was performing at the level of the top 15 to 20 per cent of their peers in such things as auditory comprehension, verbal ability and language ability.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Most important of all, the traditional measures of &#39;risk&#39;, such as parents&#39; age and education, or whether they were a single parent, bore little or no relationship to the measures of achievement and language development. Children in the programme performed equally well regardless of socio-economic disadvantages. Child abuse was virtually eliminated. The one factor that was found to affect the child&#39;s development was family stress leading to a poor quality of parent-child interaction. That interaction was not necessarily bad in poorer families.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">These research findings are exciting. There is growing evidence in New Zealand that children from poorer socio-economic backgrounds are arriving at school less well developed and that our school system tends to perpetuate that disadvantage. The initiative outlined above could break that cycle of disadvantage. The concept of working with parents in their homes, or at their place of work, contrasts quite markedly with the report of the Early Childhood Care and Education Working Group.

That\'s observed not just in New Zealand, but also in Australia, Britain and America. In an attempt to overcome that educational under-achievement, a nationwide programme called \'Headstart\' was launched in the United Slates in 1965. A lot of money was poured into it. It took children into pre-school institutions at the age of three and was supposed to help the children of poorer families succeed in school.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-3 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503584675645\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"143\" id=\"hl-answer-143\">Despite substantial funding, results have been disappointing</span>. It is thought that there are two explanations for this. First, the programme began too late. Many children who entered it at the age of three were already behind their peers in language and measurable intelligence. Second, the parents were not involved. At the end of each day, \'Headstart\' children returned to the same disadvantaged home environment.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">As a result of the growing research evidence of the importance of the first three years of a child\'s life and the disappointing results from \'Headstart\', a pilot programme was launched in Missouri in the US that focused on parents as the child\'s first teachers. The \'Missouri\' programme was predicated on research showing that working with the family, rather than bypassing the parents, is the most effective way of helping children get off to the best possible start in life. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-1 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503584654285\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"141\" id=\"hl-answer-141\">The four-year pilot study included 380 families who were about to have their first child and who represented a cross-section of socio-economic status, age and family configurations.</span> They included single-parent and two-parent families, families in which both parents worked, and families with either the mother or father at home.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The programme involved trained parent- educators visiting the parents\' home and working with tire parent, or parents, and the child. Information on child development, and guidance on things to look for and expect as the child grows were provided, plus guidance in fostering the child\'s intellectual, language, social and motor-skill development. Periodic check-ups of the child\'s educational and sensory development (hearing and vision) were made to detect possible handicaps that interfere with growth and development. Medical problems were referred to professionals.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Parent-educators made personal visits to homes and monthly group meetings were held with other new parents to share experience and discuss topics of interest. Parent resource centres, located in school buildings, offered learning materials for families and facilitators for child core.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">At the age of three, the children who had been involved in the \'Missouri\' programme were evaluated alongside a cross-section of children selected from the same range of socio-economic backgrounds and family situations, and also a random sample of children that age. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-4 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503584684493\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"144\" id=\"hl-answer-144\">The results were phenomenal</span>. By the age of three, the children in the programme were significantly more advanced in language development than their peers, had made greater strides in problem solving and other intellectual skills, and were further along in social development, tn fact, the average child on the programme was performing at the level of the top 15 to 20 per cent of their peers in such things as auditory comprehension, verbal ability and language ability.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Most important of all, the traditional measures of \'risk\', such as parents\' age and education, or whether they were a single parent, bore little or no relationship to the measures of achievement and language development. Children in the programme performed equally well regardless of socio-economic disadvantages. Child abuse was virtually eliminated. The one factor that was found to affect the child\'s development was family stress leading to a poor quality of parent-child interaction. That interaction was not necessarily bad in poorer families.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">These research findings are exciting. There is growing evidence in New Zealand that children from poorer socio-economic backgrounds are arriving at school less well developed and that our school system tends to perpetuate that disadvantage. The initiative outlined above could break that cycle of disadvantage. The concept of working with parents in their homes, or at their place of work, contrasts quite markedly with the report of the Early Childhood Care and Education Working Group. Their focus is on getting children and mothers access to childcare and institutionalised early childhood education. Education from the age of three to five is undoubtedly vital, but without a similar focus on parent education and on the vital importance of the first three years, some evidence indicates that it will not be enough to overcome educational inequity.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n', 'test 6 locating information.png', 1, '2017-08-24 21:25:43', '2017-08-24 21:25:43');

In the 1940s,&nbsp;he single-handedly created an entire science of communication which has since&nbsp;inveigled its way into a host of applications, from DVDs to satellite communications&nbsp;to bar codes - any area, in short, where data has to be conveyed rapidly yet&nbsp;accurately.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">This all seems light years away from the down-to-earth uses Shannon originally had for his work, which began when he was a 22-year-old graduate engineering&nbsp;student at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1939. He set out&nbsp;with an apparently simple aim: to pin down the precise meaning of the concept&nbsp;of &lsquo;information&rsquo;. The most basic form of information, Shannon argued, is whether&nbsp;something is true or false - which can be captured in the binary unit, or &lsquo;bit&rsquo;, of the&nbsp;form 1 or 0. Having identified this fundamental unit, Shannon set about defining&nbsp;otherwise vague ideas about information and how to transmit it from place to place.&nbsp;In the process he discovered something surprising: it is always possible to guarantee&nbsp;information will get through random interference - &lsquo;noise&rsquo; - intact.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Noise usually means unwanted sounds which interfere with genuine information. Information theory generalises this idea via theorems that capture the effects of&nbsp;noise with mathematical precision. In particular, Shannon showed that noise sets&nbsp;a limit on the rate at which information can pass along communication channels&nbsp;while remaining error-free. This rate depends on the relative strengths of the signal&nbsp;and noise travelling down the communication channel, and on its capacity (its&nbsp;&lsquo;bandwidth&rsquo;). The resulting limit, given in units of bits per second, is the absolute&nbsp;maximum rate of error-free communication given signal strength and noise level. The&nbsp;trick, Shannon showed, is to find ways of packaging up - &lsquo;coding&rsquo; - information to&nbsp;cope with the ravages of noise, while staying within the information-carrying capacity&nbsp;- &lsquo;bandwidth&rsquo; - of the communication system being used.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Over the years scientists have devised many such coding methods, and they have proved crucial in many technological feats. The Voyager spacecraft transmitted&nbsp;data using codes which added one extra bit for every single bit of information; the&nbsp;result was an error rate of just one bit in 10,000 - and stunningly clear pictures of&nbsp;the planets. Other codes have become part of everyday life - such as the Universal&nbsp;Product Code, or bar code, which uses a simple error-detecting system that ensures&nbsp;supermarket check-out lasers can read the price even on, say, a crumpled bag of&nbsp;crisps. As recently as 1993, engineers made a major breakthrough by discovering&nbsp;so-called turbo codes - which come very close to Shannon&rsquo;s ultimate limit for the&nbsp;maximum rate that data can be transmitted reliably, and now play a key role in the&nbsp;mobile videophone revolution.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Shannon also laid the foundations of more efficient ways of storing information, by stripping out superfluous (&lsquo;redundant&rsquo;) bits from data which contributed little real&nbsp;information. As mobile phone text messages like &lsquo;I CN C U&rsquo; show, it is often possible&nbsp;to leave out a lot of data without losing much meaning. As with error correction,&nbsp;however, there&rsquo;s a limit beyond which messages become too ambiguous. Shannon&nbsp;showed how to calculate this limit, opening the way to the design of compression&nbsp;methods that cram maximum information into the minimum space.</span></span></span></p>\n', '<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Test 7</strong></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><i>Information theory lies at the heart of everything - from DVD players and the genetic code of DNA to the physics of the universe at its most&nbsp;fundamental.

As recently as 1993, engineers made a major breakthrough by discovering&nbsp;so-called turbo codes - which come very close to Shannon’s ultimate limit for the&nbsp;maximum rate that data can be transmitted reliably, and now play a key role in the&nbsp;mobile videophone revolution.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-2 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503587099397\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"146\" id=\"hl-answer-146\">Shannon also laid the foundations of more efficient ways of storing information, by stripping out superfluous (‘redundant’) bits from data which contributed little real&nbsp;information</span>.

The first recorded pandemic of that disease in British North America detonated among the Al&shy;gonquin of Massachusetts in the early 1630s.

Covering 93,200 square kilometres, the Grand Banks are relatively shallow, ranging from 25 to 100 meters in depth. It is in this area that the cold Labrador Current mixes with the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.

In the Ebers Papyrus (one of the earliest medical documents, circa 1550 BC), it was recorded that physicians chanted to heal the sick (Castleman, 1994). In various cul&shy;tures, we have observed singing as part of healing rituals. In the world of Western medicine, however, using music in medicine lost popularity until the introduction of the radio. Researchers then started to notice that lis&shy;tening to music could have significant physical effects. Therapists noticed music could help calm anxiety, and researchers saw that listening to music, could cause a drop in blood pressure. In addition to these two areas, music has been used with cancer chemotherapy to reduce nausea, during surgery to reduce stress hormone production, during childbirth, and in stroke re&shy;covery (Castleman, 1994 and Westley, 1998). It has been shown to decrease pain as well as enhance the effectiveness of the immune system. In Japan, compilations of music are used as medication of sorts. For example, if you want to cure a headache or migraine, the album suggested is Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &quot;Spring Song&rdquo;, Dvorak&#39;s &ldquo;Humoresque&rdquo;, or part of George Gershwin&rsquo;s &quot;An American in Paris&rdquo; (Campbell, 1998). Music is also being used to assist in learning, in a phenomenon called the Mozart Effect.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Frances H. Rauscher, PhD, first demonstrated the correlation between mu&shy;sic and learning in an experiment in 1993. His experiment indicated that a 10-minute dose of Mozart could temporarily boost intelligence. Groups of students were given intelligence tests after listening to silence, relaxation tapes, or Mozart&rsquo;s &quot;Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major&rdquo; for a short time. He found that after silence, the average IQ score was 110, and after the relax&shy;ation tapes, the score rose a point. After listening to Mozart&rsquo;s music, how&shy;ever, the score jumped to 119 (Westley, 1998). Even students who did&nbsp;not like the music still had an increased score in the IQ test. Rauscher hy&shy;pothesised that &ldquo;listening to complex, non-repetitive music, like Mozart&#39;s, may stimulate neural pathways that are important in thinking&rdquo; (Castleman, 1994).</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The same experiment was repeated on rats by Rauscher and Hong Hua Li from Stanford. Rats also demonstrated enhancement in their intelligence performance. These new studies indicate that rats that were exposed to Mozart&rsquo;s showed &ldquo;increased gene expression of BDNF (a neural growth factor), CREB (a learning and memory compound), and Synapsin I (a synap&shy;tic growth protein) &rdquo; in the brain&rsquo;s hippocampus, compared with rats in the control group, which heard only white noise (e.g. the whooshing sound of a V radio tuned between stations).</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">How exactly does the Mozart Effect work? Researchers are still trying to determine the actual mechanisms for the formation of these enhanced learning pathways. Neuroscientists suspect that music can actually help build and strengthen connections between neurons in the cerebral cortex in a process similar to what occurs in brain development despite its type.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">When a baby is born, certain connections have already been made - like connections for heartbeat and breathing. As new information is learned and motor skills develop, new neural connections are formed. Neurons that are not used will eventually die while those used repeatedly will form strong connections. Although a large number of these neural connections require experience, they must also occur within a certain time frame. For example, a child born with cataracts cannot develop connections within the visual cortex. If the cataracts are removed by surgery right away, the child&rsquo;s vi&shy;sion develops normally. However, after the age of 2, if the cataracts are re&shy;moved, the child will remain blind because those pathways cannot establish themselves.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Music seems to work in the same way. In October of 1997, researchers at&nbsp;the University of Konstanz in Germany found that music actually rewires neural circuits (Begley, 1996). Although some of these circuits are formed for physical skills needed to play an instrument, just listening to music strengthens connections used in higher-order thinking. Listening to music can then be thought of as &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; for the brain, improving concentration and enhancing intuition.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">If you&rsquo;re a little sceptical about the claims made by supporters of the Mozart Effect, you&rsquo;re not alone. Many people accredit the advanced learning of some children who take music lessons to other personality traits, such as motivation and persistence, which are required in all types of learning. There have also been claims of that influencing the results of some experiments.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>G</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Furthermore, many people are critical of the role the media had in turning an isolated study into a trend for parents and music educators. After the Mozart Effect was published to the public, the sales of Mozart CDs stayed on the top of the hit list for three weeks. In an article by Michael Linton, he wrote that the research that began this phenomenon (the study by re&shy;searchers at the University of California, Irvine) showed only a temporary boost in IQ, which was not significant enough to even last throughout the course of the experiment. Using music to influence intelligence was used in Confucian civilisation and Plato alluded to Pythagorean music when he de- jj scribed its ideal state in The Republic. In both of these examples, music did not cause any overwhelming changes, and the theory eventually died out. Linton also asks, &ldquo;If Mozart&rsquo;s music were able to improve health, why was Mozart himself so frequently sick? If listening to Mozart&rsquo;s music increases intelligence and encourages spirituality, why aren&rsquo;t the world&rsquo;s smartest and most spiritual people Mozart specialists?&rdquo; Linton raises an interesting point, if the Mozart Effect causes such significant changes, why isn&rsquo;t there more documented evidence?</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>H</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The &ldquo;trendiness&rsquo;&rsquo; of the Mozart Effect may have died out somewhat, but there are still strong supporters (and opponents) of the claims made in 1993.

In the Ebers Papyrus (one of the earliest medical documents, circa 1550 BC), it was recorded that physicians chanted to heal the sick (Castleman, 1994). In various cul­tures, we have observed singing as part of healing rituals. In the world of Western medicine, however, using music in medicine lost popularity until the introduction of the radio. Researchers then started to notice that lis­tening to music could have significant physical effects. Therapists noticed music could help calm anxiety, and researchers saw that listening to music, could cause a drop in blood pressure. In addition to these two areas, music has been used with cancer chemotherapy to reduce nausea, during surgery to reduce stress hormone production, during childbirth, and in stroke re­covery (Castleman, 1994 and Westley, 1998). It has been shown to decrease pain as well as enhance the effectiveness of the immune system.

For example, if you want to cure a headache or migraine, the album suggested is Mendelssohn’s \"Spring Song”, Dvorak\'s “Humoresque”, or part of George Gershwin’s \"An American in Paris” (Campbell, 1998). Music is also being used to assist in learning, in a phenomenon called the Mozart Effect.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-3 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503648984696\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"178\" id=\"hl-answer-178\">Frances H. Rauscher, PhD, first demonstrated the correlation between mu­sic and learning in an experiment in 1993</span>. His experiment indicated that a 10-minute dose of Mozart could temporarily boost intelligence. Groups of students were given intelligence tests after listening to silence, relaxation tapes, or Mozart’s \"Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major” for a short time. He found that after silence, the average IQ score was 110, and after the relax­ation tapes, the score rose a point. After listening to Mozart’s music, how­ever, the score jumped to 119 (Westley, 1998). Even students who did&nbsp;not like the music still had an increased score in the IQ test. Rauscher hy­pothesised that “listening to complex, non-repetitive music, like Mozart\'s, may stimulate neural pathways that are important in thinking” (Castleman, 1994).</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The same experiment was repeated on rats by Rauscher and Hong Hua Li from Stanford. Rats also demonstrated enhancement in their intelligence performance. These new studies indicate that rats that were exposed to Mozart’s showed “increased gene expression of BDNF (a neural growth factor), CREB (a learning and memory compound), and Synapsin I (a synap­tic growth protein) ” in the brain’s hippocampus, compared with rats in the control group, which heard only white noise (e.g. the whooshing sound of a V radio tuned between stations).</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">How exactly does the Mozart Effect work? Researchers are still trying to determine the actual mechanisms for the formation of these enhanced learning pathways. Neuroscientists suspect that music can actually help build and strengthen connections between neurons in the cerebral cortex in a process similar to what occurs in brain development despite its type.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">When a baby is born, certain connections have already been made - like connections for heartbeat and breathing. As new information is learned and motor skills develop, new neural connections are formed. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-1 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503648950897\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"176\" id=\"hl-answer-176\">Neurons that are not used will eventually die while those used repeatedly will form strong connections.</span> Although a large number of these neural connections require experience, they must also occur within a certain time frame. For example, a child born with cataracts cannot develop connections within the visual cortex. If the cataracts are removed by surgery right away, the child’s vi­sion develops normally. However, after the age of 2, if the cataracts are re­moved, the child will remain blind because those pathways cannot establish themselves.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Music seems to work in the same way. In October of 1997, researchers at&nbsp;the University of Konstanz in Germany found that music actually rewires neural circuits (Begley, 1996). Although some of these circuits are formed for physical skills needed to play an instrument, just listening to music strengthens connections used in higher-order thinking. Listening to music can then be thought of as “exercise” for the brain, improving concentration and enhancing intuition.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">If you’re a little sceptical about the claims made by supporters of the Mozart Effect, you’re not alone. Many people accredit the advanced learning of some children who take music lessons to other personality traits, such as motivation and persistence, <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-5 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503649003856\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"180\" id=\"hl-answer-180\">which are required in all types of learning</span>. There have also been claims of that influencing the results of some experiments.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>G</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Furthermore, many people are critical of the role the media had in turning an isolated study into a trend for parents and music educators. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-2 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503648965817\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"177\" id=\"hl-answer-177\">After the Mozart Effect was published to the public, the sales of Mozart CDs stayed on the top of the hit list for three weeks. </span>In an article by Michael Linton, he wrote that the research that began this phenomenon (the study by re­searchers at the University of California, Irvine) showed only a temporary boost in IQ, which was not significant enough to even last throughout the course of the experiment. Using music to influence intelligence was used in Confucian civilisation and Plato alluded to Pythagorean music when he de- jj scribed its ideal state in The Republic. In both of these examples, music did not cause any overwhelming changes, and the theory eventually died out. Linton also asks, “If Mozart’s music were able to improve health, why was Mozart himself so frequently sick? If listening to Mozart’s music increases intelligence and encourages spirituality, why aren’t the world’s smartest and most spiritual people Mozart specialists?” Linton raises an interesting point, if the Mozart Effect causes such significant changes, why isn’t there more documented evidence?</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>H</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The “trendiness’’ of the Mozart Effect may have died out somewhat, but there are still strong supporters (and opponents) of the claims made in 1993.

Normally, the Gulf Stream, laden with heat soaked up in the tropics, meanders up the east coasts of the United States and Canada. As it flows northward, the stream surrenders heat to the air.

But as the North Atlantic fills with fresh water, it grows less dense, making the waters carried northward by the Gulf Stream less able to sink. The new mass of relatively fresh water sits on top of the ocean like a big thermal blanket, threatening the thermohaline circulation. That in turn could make the Gulf Stream slow or veer southward.

By combining the records with climate data, researchers can reveal how, for example, changes in temperature affect the arrival of spring, al&shy;lowing ecologists to make improved predictions about the impact of climate change. A small band of researchers is combing through hundreds of years of records taken by thousands of amateur naturalists. And more systematic projects have also started up, producing an overwhelming response. &quot;The amount of interest is almost frightening,&quot; says Sparks, a climate researcher at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Monks Wood, Cambridgeshire.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b>&nbsp;Sparks first became aware of the army of &quot;closet phenologists&rdquo;, as he de&shy;scribes them, when a retiring colleague gave him the Marsham records.

As news of his quest spreads, people tip him off to other historical records, and more amateur phenologists come out of their closets. The Brit&shy;ish devotion to recording and collecting makes his job easier - one man from Kent sent him 30 years&#39; worth of kitchen calendars, on which he had noted the date that his neighbour&#39;s magnolia tree flowered.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b>&nbsp;Other researchers have unearthed data&nbsp;from equally odd sources. Rafe Sa&shy;garin, an ecologist at Stanford University in California, recently studied records of a betting contest in which participants attempt to guess the exact time at which a specially erected wooden tripod will fall through the surface of a thawing river. The competition has taken place annually on the Tenana River in Alaska since 1917, and analysis of the results showed that the thaw now arrives five days earlier than it did when the contest began.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b>&nbsp;Overall, such records have helped to show that, compared with 20 years ago, a raft of natural events now occur earlier across much of the northern hemi&shy;sphere, from the opening of leaves to the return of birds from migration and the emergence of butterflies from hibernation. The data can also hint at how nature will change in the future. Together with models of climate change, amateurs&#39; records could help guide conservation. Terry Root, an ecologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, has collected birdwatchers&#39; counts of wildfowl taken between 1955 and 1996 on seasonal ponds in the Ameri&shy;can Midwest and combined them with climate data and models of future warming. Her analysis shows that the increased droughts that the models predict could halve the breeding populations at the ponds. &quot;The number of waterfowl in North America will most probably drop significantly with global warming,&quot; she says.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F</b>&nbsp;But not all professionals are happy to use amateur data. &quot;A lot of scientists won&#39;t touch them, they say they&#39;re too full of problems,&quot; says Root. Because different observers can have different ideas of what constitutes, for example, an open snowdrop. &quot;The biggest concern with ad hoc observations is how carefully and systematically they were taken,&quot; says Mark Schwartz of the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who studies the interactions between plants and climate. &quot;We need to know pretty precisely what a person&#39;s been observing - if they just say &#39;I noted when the leaves came out&#39;, it might not be that useful.&quot; Measuring the onset of autumn can be particularly problem&shy;atic because deciding when leaves change colour is a more subjective pro&shy;cess than noting when they appear.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>G</b>&nbsp;Overall, most phenologists are positive about the contribution that ama&shy;teurs can make. &quot;They get at the raw power of science: careful observation of the natural world,&quot; says Sagarin. But the professionals also acknowledge the need for careful quality control. Root, for example, tries to gauge the quality of an amateur archive by interviewing its collector. &quot;You always have to worry - things as trivial as vacations can affect measurement. I disregard a lot of records because they&#39;re not rigorous enough,&quot; she says. Others suggest that the right statistics can iron out some of the problems with amateur data. Together with colleagues at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, environmental scientist Arnold van Vliet is developing statistical techniques to account for the uncertainty in amateur phenological data. With the en&shy;thusiasm of amateur phenologists evident from past records, professional researchers are now trying to create standardised recording schemes for fu&shy;ture efforts. They hope that well-designed studies will generate a volume of observations large enough to drown out the idiosyncrasies of individual recorders. The data are cheap to collect, and can provide breadth in space, time and range of species. &quot;It&#39;s very difficult to collect data on a large geo&shy;graphical scale without enlisting an army of observers,&quot; says Root.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>H</b>&nbsp;Phenology also helps to drive home messages about climate change. &quot;Be&shy;cause the public understand these records, they accept them,&quot; says Sparks.<br />\nIt can also illustrate potentially unpleasant consequences, he adds, such as the finding that more rat infestations are reported to local councils in warmer years.

Successive Marshams continued compiling these notes for 211 years.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B</b>&nbsp;Today, such records are being put to uses that their authors could not pos­sibly have expected. These data sets, and others like them, are proving in­valuable to ecologists interested in the timing of biological events, or phen­ology. By combining the records with climate data, researchers can reveal how, for example, changes in temperature affect the arrival of spring, al­lowing ecologists to make improved predictions about the impact of climate change. A small band of researchers is combing through hundreds of years of records taken by thousands of amateur naturalists. And more systematic projects have also started up, producing an overwhelming response. \"The amount of interest is almost frightening,\" says Sparks, a climate researcher at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Monks Wood, Cambridgeshire.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b>&nbsp;Sparks first became aware of the army of \"closet phenologists”, as he de­scribes them, when a retiring colleague gave him the Marsham records. He now spends much of his time following leads from one historical data set to another. As news of his quest spreads, people tip him off to other historical records, and more amateur phenologists come out of their closets. The Brit­ish devotion to recording and collecting makes his job easier - one man from Kent sent him 30 years\' worth of kitchen calendars, on which he had noted the date that his neighbour\'s magnolia tree flowered.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b>&nbsp;Other researchers have unearthed data&nbsp;from equally odd sources. Rafe Sa­garin, an ecologist at Stanford University in California, recently studied records of a betting contest in which participants attempt to guess the exact time at which a specially erected wooden tripod will fall through the surface of a thawing river. The competition has taken place annually on the Tenana River in Alaska since 1917, and analysis of the results showed that the thaw now arrives five days earlier than it did when the contest began.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b>&nbsp;Overall, such records have helped to show that, compared with 20 years ago, a raft of natural events now occur earlier across much of the northern hemi­sphere, from the opening of leaves to the return of birds from migration and the emergence of butterflies from hibernation. The data can also hint at how nature will change in the future. Together with models of climate change, amateurs\' records could help guide conservation. Terry Root, an ecologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, has collected birdwatchers\' counts of wildfowl taken between 1955 and 1996 on seasonal ponds in the Ameri­can Midwest and combined them with climate data and models of future warming. Her analysis shows that the increased droughts that the models predict could halve the breeding populations at the ponds. \"The number of waterfowl in North America will most probably drop significantly with global warming,\" she says.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>F</b>&nbsp;But not all professionals are happy to use amateur data. \"<span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-1 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503934357182\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"192\" id=\"hl-answer-192\">A lot of scientists won\'t touch them, they say they\'re too full of problems</span>,\" says Root. Because different observers can have different ideas of what constitutes, for example, an open snowdrop. \"The biggest concern with ad hoc observations is how carefully and systematically they were taken,\" says Mark Schwartz of the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who studies the interactions between plants and climate. \"We need to know pretty precisely what a person\'s been observing - if they just say \'I noted when the leaves came out\', it might not be that useful.\" <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-2 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503934386997\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"193\" id=\"hl-answer-193\">Measuring the onset of autumn can be particularly problem­atic because deciding when leaves change colour is a more subjective pro­cess than noting when they appear.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>G</b>&nbsp;Overall, most phenologists are positive about the contribution that ama­teurs can make. \"They get at the raw power of science: careful observation of the natural world,\" says Sagarin. But the professionals also acknowledge the need for careful quality control. Root, for example, tries to gauge the quality of an amateur archive by interviewing its collector. \"You always have to worry - things as trivial as vacations can affect measurement. I disregard a lot of records because they\'re not rigorous enough,\" she says. Others suggest that the right statistics can iron out some of the problems with amateur data. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-3 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503934400326\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"194\" id=\"hl-answer-194\">Together with colleagues at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, environmental scientist Arnold van Vliet is developing statistical techniques to account for the uncertainty in amateur phenological data</span>. With the en­thusiasm of amateur phenologists evident from past records, professional researchers are now trying to create standardised recording schemes for fu­ture efforts. They hope that well-designed studies will generate a volume of observations large enough to drown out the idiosyncrasies of individual recorders. The data are cheap to collect, and can provide breadth in space, time and range of species. \"It\'s very difficult to collect data on a large geo­graphical scale without enlisting an army of observers,\" says Root.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>H</b>&nbsp;<span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-4 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503934417606\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"195\" id=\"hl-answer-195\">Phenology also helps to drive home messages about climate change. \"Be­cause the public understand these records, they accept them</span>,\" says Sparks.<br>\nIt can also illustrate potentially unpleasant consequences, he adds, such as the finding that more rat infestations are reported to local councils in warmer years. And getting people involved is great for public relations. \"People are thrilled to think that the data they\'ve been collecting as a hobby can be used for something scientific - it empowers them,\" says Root.</span></span></span></p>\n', 'Multiple choice test 2.png', 1, '2017-08-28 22:33:48', '2017-08-28 22:33:48'),

Researchers are even programming computers – like those used on Lie Detector -to get at the truth by analysing the same physical cues available to the naked eye and ear. “With the proper training, many people can learn to reliably detect lies,” says Paul Ekman, professor of psychology at the University of California, San Francisco, who has spent the past 15 years studying the secret art of deception.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In order to know what kind of Lies work best, successful liars need to accurately assess other people’s emotional states. Ackman’s research shows that this same emotional intelligence is essential for good lie detectors, too. The emotional state to watch out for is stress, the conflict most liars feel between the truth and what they actually say and do.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Even high-tech lie detectors don’t detect lies as such; they merely detect the physical cues of emotions, which may or may not correspond to what the person being tested is saying. Polygraphs, for instance, measure respiration, heart rate and skin conductivity, which tend to increase when people are nervous – as they usually are when lying. Nervous people typically perspire, and the salts contained in perspiration conducts electricity. That’s why &nbsp;sudden &nbsp;leap in skin conductivity indicates nervousness -about getting caught, perhaps -which makes, in turn, suggest that someone is being economical with the truth. On the other hand, it might also mean that the lights in the television Studio are too hot- which is one reason polygraph tests are inadmissible in court. “Good lie detectors don’t rely on a single thing” &nbsp;says Ekma ,but interpret clusters of verbal and non-verbal clues that suggest someone might be lying.”</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The clues are written all over the face. Because the musculature of the face is directly connected to the areas of the brain that processes emotion, the countenance &nbsp;can be a window to the soul. Neurological studies even suggest that genuine emotions travel different pathways through the brain than insincere ones. If a patient paralyzed by stroke on one side of the face, for example, is asked to &nbsp;smile deliberately, only the mobile side of the mouth is raised. But tell that same person a funny joke, and the patient breaks into a full and spontaneous smile. Very few people -most notably, actors and politicians- are able to consciously control all of their facial expressions. Lies can often be caught when the liars true feelings briefly leak through the mask of deception. We don’t think before we feel, Ekman says. “Expressions tend to show up on the face before we’re even conscious of experiencing an emotion.”</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">One of the most difficult facial expressions to fake- or conceal, if it’s genuinely felt - is sadness. When someone is truly sad, the forehead wrinkles with grief and the inner corners of the eyebrows are pulled up. Fewer than 15% of the people Ekman&nbsp;tested were able to produce this eyebrow movement voluntarily. By contrast, the lowering of the eyebrows associated with an angry scowl can be replicated at will but almost everybody. “ If someone claims they are sad and the inner corners of their eyebrows don’t go up, Ekmam says, the sadness is probably false.”</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The smile, on the other hand, is one of the easiest facial expressions to counterfeit. It takes just two muscles -the zygomaticus major muscles that extend from the cheekbones to the corners of the lips- to produce a grin. But there’s a catch. A genuine smile affects not only the corners of the lips but also the orbicularis oculi, the muscle around the eye that produces the distinctive “crow’s feet” associated with people who laugh a lot. A counterfeit grin can be unmasked if the corners of the lips go up, the eyes crinkle, &nbsp;but the inner corners of the eyebrows are not lowered, a movement controlled by the orbicularis oculi that is difficult to fake. The absence of lowered eyebrows is one reason why the smile looks so strained and stiff.</span></span></span></p>\n', 'Multiple choice test 3.png', 1, '2017-08-29 09:07:19', '2017-08-29 09:07:19');

If animals evolve preferences for sound as we do - based upon the soundscape in which they live - then their &quot;music&quot; would be fundamentally different from ours. In the same way our scales derive from human utterances, a cat&#39;s idea of a good tune would derive from yowls and meows.

They found that while the performance of the subjects remained stable for several hours after completion of the training,&nbsp;their brain activity did not; different regions of the brain were predominantly active at different times over a period of several hours after the training. The activity shifted from the prefrontal cortex to two areas known to be involved in controlling movements, the motor cortex and cerebellar cortex.

In an extensive series of studies using rats with electrodes implanted in the auditory cortex, Norman Weinberger reported that, after a tone of specific frequency was paired a few times with footshock, neurons in the rats&rsquo; auditory cortex responded more to that specific tone and less to other tones of other frequencies.

Certainly, one can wonder why we have a form of memory that we have to rely on for many hours, days or a lifetime, that is so susceptible to disruption shortly after it is initiated. Perhaps the brain system that consolidates long-term memory over time was a late development in vertebrate evolution. Moreover, maybe we consolidate memories slowly because our mammalian brains are large and enormously complex. We can readily reject these ideas. All species of animals studied to date have both short and long-term memory; and all are susceptible to retrograde amnesia.

Cialdini, Professor of Psychology at Arizona State University, one reason that companies don&rsquo;t succeed as often as they should is that innovation starts with recruitment. Research shows that the fit between an employee&rsquo;s values and a company&rsquo;s values makes a difference to what contribution they make and whether, two years after they join, they&rsquo;re still at the company. Studies at Harvard Business School show that, although some individuals may be more creative than others, almost every individual can be creative in the right circumstances.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">One of the most famous photographs in the story of rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll emphasises Ciaidini&rsquo;s views. The 1956 picture of singers Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis jamming at a piano in Sun Studios in Memphis tells a hidden story. Sun&rsquo;s &lsquo;million-dollar quartet&rsquo; could have been a quintet. Missing from the picture is Roy Orbison&rsquo; a greater natural singer than Lewis, Perkins or Cash. Sam Phillips, who owned Sun, wanted to revolutionise popular music with songs that fused black and white music, and country and blues. Presley, Cash, Perkins and Lewis instinctively understood Phillips&rsquo;s ambition and believed in it. Orbison wasn&rsquo;t inspired by the goal, and only ever achieved one hit with the Sun label.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The value fit matters, says Cialdini, because innovation is, in part, a process of change, and under that pressure we, as a species, behave differently, &lsquo;When things change, we are hard-wired to play it safe.&rsquo; Managers should therefore adopt an approach that appears counterintuitive -they should explain what stands to be lost if the company fails to seize a particular opportunity. Studies show that we invariably take more gambles when threatened with a loss than when offered a reward.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Managing innovation is a delicate art. It&rsquo;s easy for a company to be pulled in conflicting directions as the marketing, product development, and finance departments each get different feedback from different sets of people. And without a system which ensures collaborative exchanges within the company, it&rsquo;s also easy for small &lsquo;pockets of innovation‟ to disappear. Innovation is a contact sport. You can‟t brief people just by saying, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going in this direction and I&rsquo;m going to take you with me.&rsquo;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Cialdini believes that this &lsquo;follow-the-leader syndrome, is dangerous, not least because it encourages bosses to go it alone. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s been scientifically proven that three people will be better than&nbsp;one at solving problems, even if that one person is the smartest person in the field.&rsquo; To prove his point, Cialdini cites an interview with molecular biologist James Watson. Watson, together with Francis Crick, discovered the structure of DNA, the genetic information carrier of all living organisms. &lsquo;When asked how they had cracked the code ahead of an array of highly accomplished rival investigators, he said something that stunned me. He said &rdquo;he and Crick had succeeded because they were aware that they weren&rsquo;t the most intelligent of the scientists pursuing the answer. The smartest scientist was called Rosalind Franklin who, Watson said, &ldquo;was so intelligent she rarely sought advice&rdquo;.&rsquo;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Teamwork taps into one of the basic drivers of human behaviour. &lsquo;The principle of social proof is so pervasive that we don&rsquo;t even recognise it,&rsquo; says Cialdini. &lsquo;If your project is being resisted, for example, by a group of veteran employees, ask another old-timer to speak up for it.&rsquo; Cialdini is not alone in advocating this strategy. Research shows that peer power, used horizontally not vertically, is much more powerful than any boss&rsquo;s speech.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Writing, visualising and prototyping can stimulate the flow of new ideas. Cialdini cites scores of research papers and historical events that prove that even something as simple as writing deepens every individual&rsquo;s engagement in the project. It is, he says, the reason why all those competitions on breakfast cereal packets encouraged us to write in saying, in no more than 10 words: &lsquo;I like Kellogg&rsquo;s Com Flakes because&hellip; .&rsquo; The very act of writing makes us more likely to believe it.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Authority doesn&rsquo;t have to inhibit innovation but it often does. The wrong kind of leadership will lead to what Cialdini calls &rdquo;captainitis, the regrettable tendency of team members to opt out of team responsibilities that are properly their&rsquo;. He calls it captainitis because, he says, &rdquo;crew members of multipilot aircraft exhibit a sometimes deadly passivity when the flight captain makes a clearly wrong-headed decision&rdquo;. This behaviour is not, he says, unique to air travel, but can happen in any workplace where the leader is overbearing.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">At the other end of the scale is the 1980s Memphis design collective, a group of young designers for whom &rdquo;the only rule was that there were no rule&rdquo;. This environment encouraged a free interchange of ideas, which led to more creativity with form, function, colour and materials that revolutionised attitudes to furniture design.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Many theorists believe the ideal boss should lead from behind, taking pride in collective accomplishment and giving credit where it is due. Cialdini says:&rdquo;Leaders should encourage everyone to contribute and simultaneously assure all concerned that every recommendation is important to making the right decision and will be given full attention&rdquo; The frustrating thing about innovation is that there are many approaches, but no magic formula. However, a manager who wants to create a truly innovative culture can make their job a lot easier by recognising these psychological realities.</span></span></span></p>\n', '<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Test 6</strong></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>Why are so few companies truly innovative?</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Innovation is key to business survival<span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">，</span>and companies put substantial resources into inspiring employees to develop new ideas.

Cialdini cites scores of research papers and historical events that prove that even something as simple as writing deepens every individual’s engagement in the project. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-3 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503976880212\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"212\" id=\"hl-answer-212\">It is, he says, the reason why all those competitions on breakfast cereal packets encouraged us to write in saying, in no more than 10 words: ‘I like Kellogg’s Com Flakes because… .’ The very act of writing makes us more likely to believe it.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Authority doesn’t have to inhibit innovation but it often does. The wrong kind of leadership will lead to what Cialdini calls ”captainitis, the regrettable tendency of team members to opt out of team responsibilities that are properly their’. He calls it captainitis because, he says, ”crew members of multipilot aircraft exhibit a sometimes deadly passivity when the flight captain makes a clearly wrong-headed decision”. This behaviour is not, he says, unique to air travel, but can happen in any workplace where the leader is overbearing.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">At the other end of the scale is the 1980s Memphis design collective, a group of young designers for whom ”the only rule was that there were no rule”. This environment encouraged a free interchange of ideas, which led to more creativity with form, function, colour and materials that revolutionised attitudes to furniture design.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Many theorists believe the ideal boss should lead from behind, taking pride in collective accomplishment and giving credit where it is due.

However, it wasn&rsquo;t until the discovery of the reaction principle, which was the key to space travel and so represents one of the great milestones in the history of scientific thought, that rocket technology was able to develop. Not only did it solve a problem that had intrigued man for ages, but, more importantly, it literally opened the door to exploration of the universe.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">An intellectual breakthrough, brilliant though it may be, does not automatically ensure that the transition is made from theory to practice. Despite the fact that rockets had been used sporadically for several hundred years, they remained a relatively minor artefact of civilisation until the twentieth century. Prodigious efforts, accelerated during two world wars, were required before the technology of primitive rocketry could be translated into the reality of sophisticated astronauts. It is strange that the rocket was generally ignored by writers of fiction to transport their heroes to mysterious realms beyond the Earth, even though it had been commonly used in fireworks displays in China since the thirteenth century. The reason is that nobody associated the reaction principle with the idea of travelling through space to a neighbouring world.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">A simple analogy can help us to understand how a rocket operates. It is much like a machine gun mounted on the rear of a boat. In reaction to the backward discharge of bullets, the gun, and hence the boat, move forwards. A rocket motor&rsquo;s &lsquo;bullets&rsquo; are minute, high-speed particles produced by burning propellants in a suitable chamber. The reaction to the ejection of these small particles causes the rocket to move forwards. There is evidence that the reaction principle was applied practically well before the rocket was invented. In his Noctes Atticae or Greek Nights, Aulus Gellius describes &lsquo;the pigeon of Archytas&rsquo;, an invention dating back to about 360 BC. Cylindrical in shape, made of wood, and hanging from string, it was moved to and fro by steam blowing out from small exhaust ports at either end. The reaction to the discharging steam provided the bird with motive power.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The invention of rockets is linked inextricably with the invention of &lsquo;black powder&rsquo;. Most historians of technology credit the Chinese with its discovery. They base their belief on studies of Chinese writings or on the notebooks of early Europeans who settled in or made long visits to China to study its history and civilisation. It is probable that, some time in the tenth century, black powder was first compounded from its basic ingredients of saltpetre, charcoal and sulphur. But this does not mean that it was immediately used to propel rockets. By the thirteenth century, powder- propelled fire arrows had become rather common. The Chinese relied on this type of technological development to produce incendiary projectiles of many sorts,&nbsp;explosive grenades and possibly cannons to repel their enemies. One such weapon was the &lsquo;basket of fire&rsquo; or, as directly translated from Chinese, the &lsquo;arrows like flying leopards&rsquo;. The 0.7 metre-long arrows, each with a long tube of gunpowder attached near the point of each arrow, could be fired from a long, octagonal-shaped basket at the same time and had a range of 400 paces. Another weapon was the &lsquo;arrow as a flying sabre&rsquo;, which could be fired from crossbows. The rocket, placed in a similar position to other rocket-propelled arrows, was designed to increase the range.

However, it wasn’t until the discovery of the reaction principle, which was the key to space travel and so represents one of the great milestones in the history of scientific thought, that rocket technology was able to develop. Not only did it solve a problem that had intrigued man for ages, but, more importantly, it literally opened the door to exploration of the universe.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>B</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">An intellectual breakthrough, brilliant though it may be, does not automatically ensure that the transition is made from theory to practice. Despite the fact that rockets had been used sporadically for several hundred years, they remained a relatively minor artefact of civilisation until the twentieth century. Prodigious efforts, accelerated during two world wars, were required before the technology of primitive rocketry could be translated into the reality of sophisticated astronauts. It is strange that the rocket was generally ignored by writers of fiction to transport their heroes to mysterious realms beyond the Earth, even though it had been commonly used in fireworks displays in China since the thirteenth century. The reason is that nobody associated the reaction principle with the idea of travelling through space to a neighbouring world.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>C</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">A simple analogy can help us to understand how a rocket operates. It is much like a machine gun mounted on the rear of a boat. In reaction to the backward discharge of bullets, the gun, and hence the boat, move forwards. A rocket motor’s ‘bullets’ are minute, high-speed particles produced by burning propellants in a suitable chamber. The reaction to the ejection of these small particles causes the rocket to move forwards. There is evidence that the reaction principle was applied practically well before the rocket was invented. In his Noctes Atticae or Greek Nights, Aulus Gellius describes ‘the pigeon of Archytas’, an invention dating back to about 360 BC. Cylindrical in shape, made of wood, and hanging from string, it was moved to and fro by steam blowing out from small exhaust ports at either end. The reaction to the discharging steam provided the bird with motive power.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>D</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The invention of rockets is linked inextricably with the invention of ‘black powder’. Most historians of technology credit the Chinese with its discovery. They base their belief on studies of Chinese writings or on the notebooks of early Europeans who settled in or made long visits to China to study its history and civilisation. It is probable that, some time in the tenth century, black powder was first compounded from its basic ingredients of saltpetre, charcoal and sulphur. But this does not mean that it was immediately used to propel rockets. By the thirteenth century, powder- propelled fire arrows had become rather common. The Chinese relied on this type of technological development to produce incendiary projectiles of many sorts,&nbsp;explosive grenades and possibly cannons to repel their enemies. One such weapon was the ‘basket of fire’ or, as directly translated from Chinese, the ‘arrows like flying leopards’. The 0.7 metre-long arrows, each with a long tube of gunpowder attached near the point of each arrow, could be fired from a long, octagonal-shaped basket at the same time and had a range of 400 paces. Another weapon was the ‘arrow as a flying sabre’, which could be fired from crossbows. The rocket, placed in a similar position to other rocket-propelled arrows, was designed to increase the range. A small iron weight was attached to the 1.5m bamboo shaft, just below the feathers, to increase the arrow’s stability by moving the centre of gravity to a position below the rocket. At a similar time, the Arabs had developed the ‘egg which moves and burns’. This ‘egg’ was apparently full of gunpowder and stabilised by a 1.5m tail. It was fired using two rockets attached to either side of this tail.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b>E</b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">It was not until the eighteenth century that Europe became seriously interested in the possibilities of using the rocket itself as a weapon of war and not just to propel other weapons.

Normally, the Gulf Stream, laden with heat soaked up in the tropics, meanders up the east coasts of the United States and Canada. As it flows northward, the stream surrenders heat to the air. Because the prevailing North Atlantic winds blow eastward, a lot of the heat wafts to Europe. That&rsquo;s why many scientists believe winter temperatures on the Continent are as much as 36 de&shy;grees Fahrenheit warmer than those in North America at the same latitude. Frigid Boston, for example, lies at almost precisely the same latitude as balmy Rome.

This massive column of cascading cold is the main engine powering a deep-water current called the Great Ocean Conveyor that snakes through all the world&rsquo;s oceans. But as the North Atlantic fills with fresh water, it grows less dense, making the waters carried northward by the Gulf Stream less able to sink. The new mass of relatively fresh water sits on top of the ocean like a big thermal blanket, threatening the thermohaline circulation. That in turn could make the Gulf Stream slow or veer southward. At some point, the whole system could simply shut down, and do so quickly. &ldquo;There is increasing evidence that we are getting closer to a transition point, from which we can jump to a new state.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>\n', '<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Test 1</strong></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">William Curry is a serious, sober climate scientist, not an art critic.

The result was a resin known as Novalak, which became soluble and malleable when heated. The resin was allowed to cool in shallow trays until it hardened, and then broken up and ground into powder. Other substances were then introduced: including fillers, such as woodflour, asbestos or cotton, which increase strength and moisture resistance, catalysts (substances to speed up the reaction between two chemicals without joining to either) and hexa, a compound of ammonia and formaldehyde which supplied the additional formaldehyde necessary to form a thermosetting resin. This resin was then left to cool and harden, and ground up a second time. The resulting granular powder was raw Bakelite, ready to be made into a vast range of manufactured objects. In the last stage, the heated Bakelite was poured into a hollow mould of the required shape and subjected to extreme heat and pressure, thereby &#39;setting&#39; its form for life.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The design of Bakelite objects, everything from earrings to television sets, was governed to a large extent by the technical requirements of the moulding process.

A common general rule was that objects should taper towards the deepest part of the mould, and if necessary the product was moulded in separate pieces.

Its size was staggering. The largest oviraptorid previously discovered had been comparable in size to an emu: the majority were about as big as a turkey.

In 1999. the National Geographic Society announced that the missing link between dinosaurs and modern birds had finally been found. Named Archaeoraptor lianoingensis. the fossil in question appeared to have the head and body of a bird, with the hind legs and tail of a 124-million-year-old dromaeosaur - a family of small theropods that include the bird-like Velociraptor made famous by Jurassic Park films.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">There was a good reason why the fossil looked half-bird, half-dinosaur.

The head and body of the fake composite belonged to Yanornis martini, a primitive fish-eating bird from around 120 million years ago. The dromaeosaur tail and hind legs, however, were covered in what looked like fine proto feathers. That fossil turned out to be something special. In 2000. Xu named it Microraptor and revealed that it had probably lived in the treetops. Although it couldn&#39;t fly. its curved claws provided the first real evidence that dinosaurs could have climbed trees. Three years later. Xu and his team discovered a closely related Microraptor species which changed everything. &#39;Microraptor had two salient features.&#39; Xu explains, long feathers were attached not just to its forearms but to its legs and claws. Then we noticed that these long feathers had asymmetrical vanes, a feature often associated with flight capability. This meant that we might have found a flying dinosaur.&#39;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Some extraordinary fossils have remained hidden in a collection and almost forgotten. For the&nbsp;majority of the 20th century, the palaeontology community had ignored the frozen tundra of north Alaska. There was no way. scientists believed, that cold-blooded dinosaurs could survive in such bleak, frigid conditions. But according to Alaskan dinosaur expert Tony Fiorillo. they eventually realised they were missing a trick.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The first discovery of dinosaurs in Alaska was actually made by a geologist called Robert Liscomb in 1961.&#39; says Fiorillo. &#39;Unfortunately, Robert was killed in a rockslide the following year, so his discoveries languished in a warehouse for the next two decades.&#39; In the mid-1980s, managers at the warehouse stumbled upon the box containing Liscomb&#39;s fossils during a spring clean. The bones were sent to the United States Geological Survey, where they were identified as belonging to Edmontosaurus. a duck-billed hadrosaur. Today, palaeontologists roam this frozen treasure trove searching for remains locked away in the permafrost.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The rewards are worth the effort. While studying teeth belonging to the relatively intelligent Troodon therapod. Fiorillo discovered the teeth of the Alaskan Troodon were double the size of those of its southern counterpart. &#39;Even though the morphology of individual teeth resembled that of Troodon. the size was significantly larger than the Troodon found in warmer climates. Fiorillo says that the reason lies in the Troodon&#39;s large eyes, which allowed it to hunt at dawn and at dusk - times when other dinosaurs would have struggled to see. In the polar conditions of Cretaceous Alaska, where the Sun would all but disappear for months on end, this proved a useful talent. Troodon adapted for life in the extraordinary light regimes of the polar world. With this advantage, it took over as Alaska&#39;s dominant therapod.&#39; explains Fiorillo.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Finding itself at the top of the food chain, the dinosaur evolved to giant proportions.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">It is true that some of the most staggering of recent developments have come from palaeontologists being in the right place at the right time, but this is no reflection on their knowledge or expertise. After all, not everyone knows when they&#39;ve stumbled upon something remarkable. When Argentine sheep farmer Guillermo Heredia uncovered what he believed was a petrified tree Irunk on his Patagonian farm in 1988. he had no way of realising that he&#39;d found a 1.5-metre- long tibia of the largest sauropod ever known to walk the Earth. Argenlinosaurus was 24 metres long and weighed 75 tonnes. The titanosaur was brought to the attention of the scientific community in 1993 by Rodolfo Coria and Jose Bonaparte of the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Buenos Aires. Coria points out that most breakthroughs are not made by scientists, but by ordinary folk. &#39;But the real scientific discovery is not the finding; it&#39;s what we learn from that finding.&#39; While any one of us can unearth a fossil, it takes dedicated scientists to see beyond the rock.</span></span></span></p>\n', '<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Test 3</strong></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">When news breaks of the discovery of a new species of dinosaur, you would be forgiven for thinking that the scientists who set out in search of the fossils are the ones who made die find.

But according to Alaskan dinosaur expert Tony Fiorillo. they eventually realised they were missing a trick.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The first discovery of dinosaurs in Alaska was actually made by a geologist called Robert Liscomb in 1961.\' says Fiorillo. \'Unfortunately, Robert was killed in a rockslide the following year, so his discoveries languished in a warehouse for the next two decades.\' In the mid-1980s, managers at the warehouse stumbled upon the box containing Liscomb\'s fossils during a spring clean. The bones were sent to the United States Geological Survey, where they were identified as belonging to Edmontosaurus. a duck-billed hadrosaur. Today, palaeontologists roam this frozen treasure trove searching for remains locked away in the permafrost.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The rewards are worth the effort. While studying teeth belonging to the relatively intelligent Troodon therapod. Fiorillo discovered the teeth of the Alaskan Troodon were double the size of those of its southern counterpart. \'Even though the morphology of individual teeth resembled that of Troodon. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-6 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503993017720\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"235\" id=\"hl-answer-235\">the size was significantly larger than the Troodon found in warmer climates</span>. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-5 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503993009520\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"232\" id=\"hl-answer-232\">Fiorillo says that the reason lies in the Troodon\'s large eyes, which allowed it to hunt at dawn and at dusk - times when other dinosaurs would have struggled to see</span>. In the polar conditions of Cretaceous Alaska, where the Sun would all but disappear for months on end, this proved a useful talent. Troodon adapted for life in the extraordinary light regimes of the polar world. With this advantage, it took over as Alaska\'s dominant therapod.\' explains Fiorillo.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-7 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1503993026264\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"234\" id=\"hl-answer-234\">Finding itself at the top of the food chain, the dinosaur evolved to giant proportions.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">It is true that some of the most staggering of recent developments have come from palaeontologists being in the right place at the right time, but this is no reflection on their knowledge or expertise. After all, not everyone knows when they\'ve stumbled upon something remarkable. When Argentine sheep farmer Guillermo Heredia uncovered what he believed was a petrified tree Irunk on his Patagonian farm in 1988. he had no way of realising that he\'d found a 1.5-metre- long tibia of the largest sauropod ever known to walk the Earth. Argenlinosaurus was 24 metres long and weighed 75 tonnes. The titanosaur was brought to the attention of the scientific community in 1993 by Rodolfo Coria and Jose Bonaparte of the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Buenos Aires. Coria points out that most breakthroughs are not made by scientists, but by ordinary folk. \'But the real scientific discovery is not the finding; it\'s what we learn from that finding.\' While any one of us can unearth a fossil, it takes dedicated scientists to see beyond the rock.</span></span></span></p>\n', 'labelling and noting test 3.png', 1, '2017-08-29 14:50:33', '2017-08-29 14:50:33');

This led to an important decision being taken: namely to&nbsp;carry out the lifting operation in three very&nbsp;distinct stages. The hull was attached to&nbsp;a lifting frame via a network of bolts and&nbsp;lifting wires. The problem of the hull being&nbsp;sucked back downwards into the mud was&nbsp;overcome by using 12 hydraulic jacks.&nbsp;These raised it a few centimetres over a&nbsp;period of several days, as the lifting frame&nbsp;rose slowly up its four legs. It was only&nbsp;when the hull was hanging freely from&nbsp;the lifting frame, clear of the seabed and&nbsp;the suction effect of the surrounding mud,&nbsp;that the salvage operation progressed to&nbsp;the second stage. In this stage, the lifting&nbsp;frame was fixed to a hook attached to a&nbsp;crane, and the hull was lifted completely&nbsp;clear of the seabed and transferred&nbsp;underwater into the lifting cradle. This&nbsp;required precise positioning to locate the&nbsp;legs into the stabbing guides&rsquo; of the lifting&nbsp;cradle. The lifting cradle was designed&nbsp;to fit the hull jusing archaeological survey&nbsp;drawings, and was fitted with air bags to&nbsp;provide additional cushioning for the hull&rsquo;s&nbsp;delicate timber framework. The third and&nbsp;final stage was to lift the entire structure&nbsp;into the air, by which time the hull was&nbsp;also supported from below. Finally, on 11&nbsp;October 1982, millions of people around&nbsp;the world held their breath as the timber&nbsp;skeleton of the Mary Rose was lifted clear&nbsp;of the water, ready to be returned home to&nbsp;Portsmouth.</span></span></span></p>\n', '<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Test 4</strong></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b><i>How a sixteenth-century warship was recovered from the seabed</i></b></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">On 19 July 1545, English and French fleets were engaged in a sea battle off&nbsp;the coast of southern England in the&nbsp;area of water called the Solent, between&nbsp;Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight.

The study estimates that today, non-communicable diseases account for 85 per cent of the burden of disease in high-income countries and a surprising 44 per cent of the burden of disease in low- and middle-income countries. Non-communicable diseases already account for as much of the burden of disease in low- and middle-income countries as all communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal conditions, and nutritional conditions. By 2030, according to projections, the share of the burden attributed to non-communicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries will reach 54 per cent, while the share attributed to communicable diseases will fall to 32 per cent. If we restrict attention to older ages, non-communicable diseases already account for more than 87 per cent of the burden for the over-60 population in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. The critical issue for low- and middle-income countries is how to mobilise and allocate resources to address non-communicable diseases, as they continue to struggle with the continued high prevalence of communicable diseases.

Studies predict that, in the near term, surplus capital will flow from Europe and North America to emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, where the population is younger and cheaper and supplies of capital relatively low. In another 20 years, when the baby boom generation in the West has mostly retired, capital will most likely flow in the opposite direction. However, these studies rest on the uncertain assumption that capital will flow easily across national boundaries.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Despite the weight of scientific evidence, the significance of population aging and its global implications have yet to be wholly appreciated.

Preparing financially for longer lives and finding ways to reduce aging-related disability should become national and global priorities.

The aims of these early grammarians&nbsp;were threefold: (a) they wanted to codify the principles of their languages, to show that&nbsp;there was a system beneath the apparent chaos of usage, (b) they wanted a means of&nbsp;settling disputes over usage, and (c) they wanted to point out what they felt to be common&nbsp;errors, in order to &#39;improve&#39; the language. The authoritarian nature of the approach is best&nbsp;characterised by its reliance on &lsquo;rules&#39; of grammar. Some usages are &#39;prescribed,&#39; to be&nbsp;learnt and followed accurately; others are &#39;proscribed,&#39; to be avoided. In this early period,&nbsp;there were no half-measures: usage was either right or wrong, and it was the task of the&nbsp;grammarian not simply to record alternatives, but to pronounce judgement upon them.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">These attitudes are still with us, and they motivate a widespread concern that linguistic standards should be maintained. Nevertheless, there is an alternative point of view that&nbsp;is concerned less with standards than with the facts of linguistic usage. This approach is&nbsp;summarised in the statement that it is the task of the grammarian to describe, not prescribe to record the facts of linguistic diversity, and not to attempt the impossible tasks of evaluating language variation or halting language change. In the second half of the 18th&nbsp;century, we already find advocates of this view, such as Joseph Priestiey, whose Rudiments&nbsp;of English Grammar (1761) insists that &#39;the custom of speaking is the original and only&nbsp;just standard of any language!

The aims of these early grammarians&nbsp;were threefold: (a) they wanted to codify the principles of their languages, to show that&nbsp;there was a system beneath the apparent chaos of usage, (b) they wanted a means of&nbsp;settling disputes over usage, and (c) they wanted to point out what they felt to be common&nbsp;errors, in order to \'improve\' the language. The authoritarian nature of the approach is best&nbsp;characterised by its reliance on ‘rules\' of grammar. Some usages are \'prescribed,\' to be&nbsp;learnt and followed accurately; others are \'proscribed,\' to be avoided. In this early period,&nbsp;there were no half-measures: usage was either right or wrong, and it was the task of the&nbsp;grammarian not simply to record alternatives, but to pronounce judgement upon them.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-5 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1504065805613\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"271\" id=\"hl-answer-271\">These attitudes are still with us, and they motivate a widespread concern that linguistic standards should be maintained</span>. Nevertheless, there is an alternative point of view that&nbsp;is concerned less with standards than with the facts of linguistic usage. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-6 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1504065815573\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"272\" id=\"hl-answer-272\">This approach is&nbsp;summarised in the statement that it is the task of the grammarian to describe, not prescribe to record the facts of linguistic diversity, and not to attempt the impossible tasks of evaluating language variation or halting language change</span>. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-7 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1504065823685\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"273\" id=\"hl-answer-273\">In the second half of the 18th&nbsp;century, we already find advocates of this view</span>, such as Joseph Priestiey, whose Rudiments&nbsp;of English Grammar (1761) insists that \'the custom of speaking is the original and only&nbsp;just standard of any language! Linguistic issues, it is argued, cannot be solved by logic&nbsp;and legislation. And this view has become the tenet of the modern linguistic approach to&nbsp;grammatical analysis.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-8 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1504065832676\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"274\" id=\"hl-answer-274\">In our own time, the opposition between \'descriptivists\' and \'prescriptivists\' has often become extreme, with both sides painting unreal pictures of the other</span>. Descriptive&nbsp;grammarians have been presented as people who do not care about standards, because&nbsp;of the way they see all forms of usage as equally valid. Prescriptive grammarians have&nbsp;been presented as blind adherents to a historical tradition. The opposition has even been&nbsp;presented in quasi-political terms - of radical liberalism vs elitist conservatism</span></span></span></p>\n', 'identifying clams and views test 3.png', 1, '2017-08-30 11:08:04', '2017-08-30 11:08:04');

Since the only genuinely child-oriented literature at this time would have been a few instructional works to help with reading and general knowledge, plus the odd Puritanical tract as an aid to morality, the only course for keen child readers was to read adult literature.

He had succumbed to the third and most lethal wave of the Russian flu pandemic sweeping the world. The nation was shocked. The people mourned. Albert was relegated to a footnote in history.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Three days later, London housewife Louisa Carlill went down with flu. She was shocked. For two months, she had inhaled thrice daily from a carbolic smoke ball, a preventive measure guaranteed to fend off flu - if you believed the advert. Which she did. And why shouldn&rsquo;t she when the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company had promised to cough up &pound;100 for any customer who fell ill? Unlike Albert, Louisa recovered, claimed her &pound;100 and set in train events that would win her lasting fame.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">It started in the spring of 1889. The first reports of a flu epidemic came from Russia. By the end of the year, the world was in the grip of the first truly global flu pandemic. The disease came in waves, once a year for the next four years, and each worse than the last.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Whole cities came to a standstill. London was especially hard-hit. As the flu reached each annual peak, normal life stopped. The postal service ground to a halt, trains stopped running, banks closed. Even courts stopped sitting for lack of judges. At the height of the third wave in 1892, 200 people were buried every day at just one London cemetery. This flu was far more lethal than previ&shy;ous epidemics, and those who recovered were left weak, depressed, and often unfit for work. It was a picture repeated across the continent.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Accurate figures for the number of the sick and dead were few and far between but Paris, Berlin and Vienna all reported a huge upsurge in deaths. The news&shy;papers took an intense interest in the disease, not just because of the scale of it but because of who it attacked. Most epidemics carried off the poor and weak, the old and frail. This flu was cutting as great a swathe through the upper classes, dealing death to the rich and famous, and the young and fit.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The newspaper-reading public was fed a daily diet of celebrity victims. The flu had worked its way through the Russian imperial family and invaded the royal palaces of Europe. It carried off the Dowager Empress of Germany and the second son of the king of Italy, as well as England&rsquo;s future king. Aristocrats and politicians, poets and opera singers, bishops and cardinals - none escaped the attentions of the Russian flu.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The public grew increasingly fearful. The press might have been overdoing the doom and gloom, but their hysterical coverage had exposed one terrible fact.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The medical profession had no answer to the disease. This flu, which might ft not even have begun in Russia, was a mystery. What caused it and how did it spread? No one could agree on anything.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">By now, the theory that micro-organisms caused disease was gaining ground, g but no one had identified an organism responsible for flu (and wouldn&rsquo;t until 1933). In the absence of a germ, many clung to the old idea of bad airs, or mi&shy;asmas, possibly stirred by some great physical force - earthquakes, perhaps, or electrical phenomena in the upper atmosphere, even a passing comet.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Doctors advised people to eat well avoiding &ldquo;unnecessary assemblies&rdquo;, and if they were really worried, to stuff cotton wool up their nostrils. If they fell ill, they should rest, keep warm and eat a nourishing diet of &ldquo;milk, eggs and farinaceous puddings&rdquo;. Alcohol figured prominently among the prescriptions: one eminent English doctor suggested champagne, although he conceded &ldquo;brandy M in considerable quantities has sometimes been given with manifest advantages&rdquo;. French doctors prescribed warm alcoholic drinks, arguing that they never saw an alcoholic with flu. Their prescription had immediate results: over a three-day period, 1,200 of the 1,500 drunks picked up on the streets of Paris claimed they were following doctor&rsquo;s orders.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Some doctors gave drugs to ease symptoms - quinine for fever, salicin for head&shy;ache, heroin for an &ldquo;incessant cough&rdquo;. But nothing in the pharmacy remotely resembled a cure. Not surprisingly, people looked elsewhere for help. Hoping to cash in while the pandemic lasted, purveyors of patent medicines competed for the public&rsquo;s custom with ever more outrageous advertisements. One of the most successful was the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The carbolic smoke ball was a hollow rubber ball, 5 centimetres across, with a nozzle covered by gauze. Inside was a powder treated with carbolic acid, or phenol. The idea was to clutch it close to the nose and squeeze gently, inhaling deeply from the emerging cloud of pungent powder. This, the company claimed, would disinfect the mucous membranes, curing any condition related to &ldquo;taking cold&rdquo;. In the summer of 1890, sales were steady at 300 smoke balls a month. In January 1891, the figure skyrocketed to 1,500.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Eager to exploit the public&rsquo;s mounting panic, the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company made increasingly extravagant claims. Oh 13 November 1892, its latest advert in the Pall Mall Gazette caught the eye of south London housewife Louisa Carlill. &ldquo;Carbolic Smoke Ball,&rdquo; it declared, &ldquo;will positively cure colds, coughs, asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, croup, whooping cough ...&rdquo;. And the list went on. But it was the next part Mrs. Carlill found compelling. &ldquo;A &pound;100 reward will be paid by the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company to any person who contracts the increasing epidemic influenza, colds or any disease caused by taking cold, after having used the carbolic smoke ball according to the printed directions supplied with each ball. &pound;1,000 is deposited with the Alliance bank, Regent Street, showing our sincerity in the matter.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Mrs. Carlill hurried off to buy a smoke ball, price 10 shillings. After carefully reading the instructions, she diligently dosed herself thrice daily until 17 Janu&shy;ary - when she fell ill.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">On 20 January, Louisa&rsquo;s husband wrote to the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company. Unfortunately for them, Mr. Carlill happened to be a solicitor. His wife, he wrote, had seen their advert and bought a smoke ball on the strength of it. She had followed the instructions to the letter, and yet now - as their doctor could confirm - she had flu.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">There was no reply. But &pound;100 was not a sum to be sneezed at. Mr. Carlill per&shy;sisted. The company resisted. Louisa recovered and sued. In June, Mr. Justice Hawkins found in Mrs. Carlill&rsquo;s favour. The company&rsquo;s main defence was that adverts were mere &ldquo;puffery&rdquo; and only an idiot would believe such extravagant claims. Judge Hawkins pointed out that adverts were not aimed at the wise and thoughtful, but at the credulous and weak. A vendor who made a promise &ldquo;must not be surprised if occasionally he is held to his promise&rdquo;.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Carbolic appealed. In December, three lord justices considered the case. Carbolic&rsquo;s lawyers tried several lines of defence. But in the end, the case came down to a single matter: not whether the remedy was useless, or whether Carbolic had committed fraud, but whether its advert constituted a contract - which the company had broken. A contract required agreement between two parties, argued Carbolic&rsquo;s lawyers.

The news­papers took an intense interest in the disease, not just because of the scale of it but because of who it attacked. Most epidemics carried off the poor and weak, the old and frail.

Alcohol figured prominently among the prescriptions: one eminent English doctor suggested champagne, although he conceded “brandy M in considerable quantities has sometimes been given with manifest advantages”. French doctors prescribed warm alcoholic drinks, arguing that they never saw an alcoholic with flu. Their prescription had immediate results: over a three-day period, 1,200 of the 1,500 drunks picked up on the streets of Paris claimed they were following doctor’s orders.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Some doctors gave drugs to ease symptoms - quinine for fever, salicin for head­ache, heroin for an “incessant cough”. But nothing in the pharmacy remotely resembled a cure. Not surprisingly, people looked elsewhere for help. Hoping to cash in while the pandemic lasted, purveyors of patent medicines competed for the public’s custom with ever more outrageous advertisements.

Oh 13 November 1892, its latest advert in the Pall Mall Gazette caught the eye of south London housewife Louisa Carlill. “Carbolic Smoke Ball,” it declared, “will positively cure colds, coughs, asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, croup, whooping cough ...”. And the list went on. But it was the next part Mrs. Carlill found compelling. “A £100 reward will be paid by the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company to any person who contracts the increasing epidemic influenza, colds or any disease caused by taking cold, after having used the carbolic smoke ball according to the printed directions supplied with each ball. £1,000 is deposited with the Alliance bank, Regent Street, showing our sincerity in the matter.”</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Mrs. Carlill hurried off to buy a smoke ball, price 10 shillings.

Unfortunately for them, Mr. Carlill happened to be a solicitor. His wife, he wrote, had seen their advert and bought a smoke ball on the strength of it. She had followed the instructions to the letter, and yet now - as their doctor could confirm - she had flu.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">There was no reply. But £100 was not a sum to be sneezed at. Mr. Carlill per­sisted. The company resisted. Louisa recovered and sued. In June, Mr. Justice Hawkins found in Mrs. Carlill’s favour. The company’s main defence was that adverts were mere “puffery” and only an idiot would believe such extravagant claims. Judge Hawkins pointed out that adverts were not aimed at the wise and thoughtful, but at the credulous and weak. A vendor who made a promise “must not be surprised if occasionally he is held to his promise”.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Carbolic appealed. In December, three lord justices considered the case. Carbolic’s lawyers tried several lines of defence. But in the end, the case came down to a single matter: not whether the remedy was useless, or whether Carbolic had committed fraud, but whether its advert constituted a contract - which the company had broken. A contract required agreement between two parties, argued Carbolic’s lawyers.

It was a picture repeated across the continent.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Accurate figures for the number of the sick and dead were few and far between but Paris, Berlin and Vienna all reported a huge upsurge in deaths. The news­papers took an intense interest in the disease, not just because of the scale of it but because of who it attacked. Most epidemics carried off the poor and weak, the old and frail. This flu was cutting as great a swathe through the upper classes, dealing death to the rich and famous, and the young and fit.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The newspaper-reading public was fed a daily diet of celebrity victims. The flu had worked its way through the Russian imperial family and invaded the royal palaces of Europe. It carried off the Dowager Empress of Germany and the second son of the king of Italy, as well as England’s future king. Aristocrats and politicians, poets and opera singers, bishops and cardinals - none escaped the attentions of the Russian flu.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The public grew increasingly fearful. The press might have been overdoing the doom and gloom, but their hysterical coverage had exposed one terrible fact.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The medical profession had no answer to the disease. This flu, which might ft not even have begun in Russia, was a mystery. What caused it and how did it spread? No one could agree on anything.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">By now, the theory that micro-organisms caused disease was gaining ground, g but no one had identified an organism responsible for flu (and wouldn’t until 1933). In the absence of a germ, many clung to the old idea of bad airs, or mi­asmas, possibly stirred by some great physical force - earthquakes, perhaps, or electrical phenomena in the upper atmosphere, even a passing comet.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Doctors advised people to eat well avoiding “unnecessary assemblies”, and if they were really worried, to stuff cotton wool up their nostrils. If they fell ill, they should rest, keep warm and eat a nourishing diet of “milk, eggs and farinaceous puddings”. Alcohol figured prominently among the prescriptions: one eminent English doctor suggested champagne, although he conceded “brandy M in considerable quantities has sometimes been given with manifest advantages”. French doctors prescribed warm alcoholic drinks, arguing that they never saw an alcoholic with flu. Their prescription had immediate results: over a three-day period, 1,200 of the 1,500 drunks picked up on the streets of Paris claimed they were following doctor’s orders.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Some doctors gave drugs to ease symptoms - quinine for fever, salicin for head­ache, heroin for an “incessant cough”. But nothing in the pharmacy remotely resembled a cure. Not surprisingly, people looked elsewhere for help. Hoping to cash in while the pandemic lasted, purveyors of patent medicines competed for the public’s custom with ever more outrageous advertisements. One of the most successful was the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-1 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1504167315495\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"290\" id=\"hl-answer-290\">The carbolic smoke ball was a hollow rubber ball, 5 centimetres across, with a nozzle covered by gauze</span>. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-3 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1504167351439\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"292\" id=\"hl-answer-292\">Inside was a powder</span> treated with carbolic acid, or phenol. The idea was to clutch it close to the nose and squeeze gently, inhaling deeply from the emerging cloud of pungent powder. This, the company claimed, would disinfect the mucous membranes, curing any condition related to “taking cold”. In the summer of 1890, sales were steady at 300 smoke balls a month. In January 1891, the figure skyrocketed to 1,500.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Eager to exploit the public’s mounting panic, the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company made increasingly extravagant claims. Oh 13 November 1892, its latest advert in the Pall Mall Gazette caught the eye of south London housewife Louisa Carlill. “Carbolic Smoke Ball,” it declared, “will positively cure colds, coughs, asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, croup, whooping cough ...”. And the list went on. But it was the next part Mrs. Carlill found compelling. “A £100 reward will be paid by the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company to any person who contracts the increasing epidemic influenza, colds or any disease caused by taking cold, after having used the carbolic smoke ball according to the printed directions supplied with each ball. £1,000 is deposited with the Alliance bank, Regent Street, showing our sincerity in the matter.”</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Mrs. Carlill hurried off to buy a smoke ball, price 10 shillings. After carefully reading the instructions, she diligently dosed herself thrice daily until 17 Janu­ary - when she fell ill.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">On 20 January, Louisa’s husband wrote to the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company. Unfortunately for them, Mr. Carlill happened to be a solicitor. His wife, he wrote, had seen their advert and bought a smoke ball on the strength of it. She had followed the instructions to the letter, and yet now - as their doctor could confirm - she had flu.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">There was no reply. But £100 was not a sum to be sneezed at. Mr. Carlill per­sisted. The company resisted. Louisa recovered and sued. In June, Mr. Justice Hawkins found in Mrs. Carlill’s favour. The company’s main defence was that adverts were mere “puffery” and only an idiot would believe such extravagant claims. Judge Hawkins pointed out that adverts were not aimed at the wise and thoughtful, but at the credulous and weak. A vendor who made a promise “must not be surprised if occasionally he is held to his promise”.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Carbolic appealed. In December, three lord justices considered the case. Carbolic’s lawyers tried several lines of defence. But in the end, the case came down to a single matter: not whether the remedy was useless, or whether Carbolic had committed fraud, but whether its advert constituted a contract - which the company had broken. A contract required agreement between two parties, argued Carbolic’s lawyers. What agreement had Mrs. Carlill made with them?</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">There were times, the judges decided, when a contract could be one-sided. The advert had made a very specific offer to purchasers: protection from flu or £100. By using the smoke ball as instructed, Mrs. Carlill had accepted that offer. The company might just have wriggled out of if if it hadn’t added the bit about the £1,000 deposit. That, said the judges, gave buyers reason to believe Carbolic meant what it said. “It seems to me that if a person chooses to make extrava­gant promises of this kind, he probably does so because it pays him to make them, and, if he has made them, the extravagance of the promises is no reason in law why he should not be bound by them,” pronounced Lord Justice Bowen.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Louisa got her £100. The case established the principle of the unilateral con­tract and is frequently cited today.</span></span></span></p>\n', 'labelling and noting test 8.png', 0, '2017-08-31 15:16:46', '2017-08-31 15:17:05'),

But the consortium&nbsp;that won the contract for the island opted for a more aggressive approach. It assembled the worlds largest fleet of dredgers, which sucked up 150m cubic metres of clay and mud and dumped it in deeper waters.

This provided 70m cubic metres of granite to add to the island&#39;s foundations. Because the heap of boulders does not fill the space perfectly, this represents the equivalent of 105m cubic metres of landfill. Most of the rock will become the foundations for the airport&#39;s runways and its taxiways. The sand dredged from the waters will also be used to provide a two-metre capping layer over the granite platform. This makes it easier for utilities to dig trenches - granite is unyielding stuff.

The blurred imagery of Impressionist paintings seems to stimulate the brain&#39;s amygdala, for instance. Since the amygdala plays a crucial role in our feelings, that finding might explain why&nbsp;many people find these pieces so moving.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Could the same approach also shed light on abstract twentieth-century pieces, from Mondrian&#39;s geometrical blocks of colour, to Pollock&#39;s seemingly haphazard arrangements&nbsp;of splashed paint on canvas? Sceptics believe that people claim to like such works simply&nbsp;because they are famous. We certainly do have an inclination to follow the crowd. When&nbsp;asked to make simple perceptual decisions such as matching a shape to its rotated image, for&nbsp;example, people often choose a definitively wrong answer if they see others doing the same. It is easy to imagine that this mentality would have even more impact on a fuzzy concept like art appreciation, where there is no right or wrong answer.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Angelina Hawley-Dolan, of Boston College, Massachusetts, responded to this debate by asking volunteers to view pairs of paintings - either the creations of famous abstract artists or&nbsp;the doodles of infants, chimps and elephants. They then had to judge which they preferred.&nbsp;A third of the paintings were given no captions, while many were labelled incorrectly -volunteers might think they were viewing a chimp&#39;s messy brushstrokes when they were actually seeing an acclaimed masterpiece. In each set of trials, volunteers generally preferred&nbsp;the work of renowned artists, even when they believed it was by an animal or a child. It seems&nbsp;that the viewer can sense the artist&#39;s vision in paintings, even if they can&#39;t explain why.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Robert Pepperell, an artist based at Cardiff University, creates ambiguous works that are neither entirely abstract nor clearly representational. In one study, Pepperell and his&nbsp;collaborators asked volunteers to decide how&#39;powerful&#39;they considered an artwork to be,&nbsp;and whether they saw anything familiar in the piece. The longer they took to answer these&nbsp;questions, the more highly they rated the piece under scrutiny, and the greater their neural&nbsp;activity. It would seem that the brain sees these images as puzzles, and the harder it is to&nbsp;decipher the meaning, the more rewarding is the moment of recognition.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">And what about artists such as Mondrian, whose paintings consist exclusively of horizontal and vertical lines encasing blocks of colour? Mondrian&#39;s works are deceptively simple, but&nbsp;eye-tracking studies confirm that they are meticulously composed, and that simpiy rotating a&nbsp;piece radically changes the way we view it. With the originals, volunteers&#39;eyes tended to stay&nbsp;longer on certain places in the image, but with the altered versions they would flit across a&nbsp;piece more rapidly. As a result, the volunteers considered the altered versions less pleasurable&nbsp;when they later rated the work.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In a similar study, Oshin Vartanian of Toronto University asked volunteers to compare original paintings with ones which he had altered by moving objects around within the frame. He&nbsp;found that almost everyone preferred the original, whether it was a Van Gogh still life or&nbsp;an abstract by Miro. Vartanian also found that changing the composition of the paintings&nbsp;reduced activation in those brain areas linked with meaning and interpretation.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In another experiment, Alex Forsythe of the University of Liverpool analysed the visual intricacy of different pieces of art, and her results suggest that many artists use a key level of&nbsp;detail to please the brain. Too little and the work is boring, but too much results in a kind of&nbsp;&#39;perceptual overload&#39;, according to Forsythe. What&#39;s more, appealing pieces both abstract and&nbsp;representational, show signs of &#39;fractals&#39; - repeated motifs recurring in different scales, fractals&nbsp;are common throughout nature, for example in the shapes of mountain peaks or the branches&nbsp;of trees.

It would, however, be foolish to reduce art appreciation to a set of scientific&nbsp;laws. We shouldn&#39;t underestimate the importance of the style of a particular artist, their place&nbsp;in history and the artistic environment of their time. Abstract art offers both a challenge and the freedom to play with different interpretations. In some ways, it&#39;s not so different to science,&nbsp;where we are constantly looking for systems and decoding meaning so that we can view and&nbsp;appreciate the world in a new way.</span></span></span></p>\n', '<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Test 9</strong></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">An emerging discipline called neuroaesthetics is seeking to bring scientific objectivity to the study of art, and has already given us a better understanding of many masterpieces. The blurred imagery of Impressionist paintings seems to stimulate the brain\'s amygdala, for instance. Since the amygdala plays a crucial role in our feelings, that finding might explain why&nbsp;many people find these pieces so moving.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Could the same approach also shed light on abstract twentieth-century pieces, from Mondrian\'s geometrical blocks of colour, to Pollock\'s seemingly haphazard arrangements&nbsp;of splashed paint on canvas? Sceptics believe that people claim to like such works simply&nbsp;because they are famous. We certainly do have an inclination to follow the crowd. When&nbsp;asked to make simple perceptual decisions such as matching a shape to its rotated image, for&nbsp;example, people often choose a definitively wrong answer if they see others doing the same. It is easy to imagine that this mentality would have even more impact on a fuzzy concept like art appreciation, where there is no right or wrong answer.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Angelina Hawley-Dolan, of Boston College, Massachusetts, responded to this debate by asking volunteers to view pairs of paintings - either the creations of famous abstract artists or&nbsp;the doodles of infants, chimps and elephants. They then had to judge which they preferred.&nbsp;A third of the paintings were given no captions, while many were labelled incorrectly -volunteers might think they were viewing a chimp\'s messy brushstrokes when they were actually seeing an acclaimed masterpiece. In each set of trials, volunteers generally preferred&nbsp;the work of renowned artists, even when they believed it was by an animal or a child. It seems&nbsp;that the viewer can sense the artist\'s vision in paintings, even if they can\'t explain why.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Robert Pepperell, an artist based at Cardiff University, creates ambiguous works that are neither entirely abstract nor clearly representational. In one study, Pepperell and his&nbsp;collaborators asked volunteers to decide how\'powerful\'they considered an artwork to be,&nbsp;and whether they saw anything familiar in the piece. The longer they took to answer these&nbsp;questions, the more highly they rated the piece under scrutiny, and the greater their neural&nbsp;activity. It would seem that the brain sees these images as puzzles, and the harder it is to&nbsp;decipher the meaning, the more rewarding is the moment of recognition.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">And what about artists such as Mondrian, whose paintings consist exclusively of horizontal and vertical lines encasing blocks of colour? Mondrian\'s works are deceptively simple, but&nbsp;eye-tracking studies confirm that they are meticulously composed, and that simpiy rotating a&nbsp;piece radically changes the way we view it. With the originals, volunteers\'eyes tended to stay&nbsp;longer on certain places in the image, but with the altered versions they would flit across a&nbsp;piece more rapidly. As a result, the volunteers considered the altered versions less pleasurable&nbsp;when they later rated the work.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In a similar study, Oshin Vartanian of Toronto University asked volunteers to compare original paintings with ones which he had altered by moving objects around within the frame. He&nbsp;found that almost everyone preferred the original, whether it was a Van Gogh still life or&nbsp;an abstract by Miro. Vartanian also found that changing the composition of the paintings&nbsp;reduced activation in those brain areas linked with meaning and interpretation.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In another experiment, Alex Forsythe of the University of Liverpool analysed the visual intricacy of different pieces of art, and her results suggest that many artists use a key level of&nbsp;detail to please the brain. Too little and the work is boring, but too much results in a kind of&nbsp;\'perceptual overload\', according to Forsythe. <span class=\"answer-highlight highlight-1 hidden-highlight\" data-timestamp=\"1504172118296\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\" data-highlighted=\"true\" data-qnumber=\"321\" id=\"hl-answer-321\">What\'s more, appealing pieces both abstract and&nbsp;representational, show signs of \'fractals\' - repeated motifs recurring in different scales, fractals&nbsp;are common throughout nature, for example in the shapes of mountain peaks or the branches&nbsp;of trees</span>.

It has been built into us; we have inherited it from our evolutionary past, because, in general, anxiety has a survival function. If there is a real danger for a primitive man, then anxiety kicks in in an adaptive way. We freeze, we stop doing whatever we were doing, we devote all of your attention to the danger, and our bodies react with a big release of adrenalin, an increase in blood flow to the muscles, getting us ready to run as fast as we can or fight as fiercely as we can.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">So some anxiety is adaptive, not only for primitive man, but in modern society as well. It helps us to focus on things when we have deadlines and, if someone is driving too fast when we cross the road, it helps us to jump out of the way quickly. So, there is nothing wrong with anxiety in general, and in fact, we would have difficulties if we did not experience it to some extent, but of course it can get problematic if the danger is one that is imagined rather than real, or the danger is something that is exaggerated. In those cases, particularly if the perceived danger is out of proportion to the real danger, and it is persistent and disabling, then there is a danger of an anxiety disorder.

Scientists are looking at what role genes play in the development of these disorders and are also investigating the effects of environmental factors, such as pollution, physical and psychological stress, and diet. Several parts of the brain are key actors in the production of fear and anxiety. Using brain imaging technology and neurochemical techniques, scientists have discovered that the amygdala plays a significant role in most anxiety disorders.

Only 10 per cent of people with an anxiety disorder will seek treatment. That seems to be largely because people do not realise there are effective treatments available. Most people tend to think they have had it for most of their lives, so it is just their personality and they cannot change their personality, and so they feel rather hopeless about it.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The first psychotherapy treatment that was shown to be effective was exposure therapy, which essentially encourages people in a graded way to go into their feared situations and stay in them as long as they can and build up their confidence that way. Often, the therapist will accompany the person to a feared situation to provide support and guidance. Group cognitive behaviour therapy has also been shown to be effective. This is a talking therapy that helps people to understand the link between negative thoughts and mood and how altering their behaviour can enable them to manage anxiety and feel in control.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">There are, of course, drugs that can help people with anxiety. Medication will not cure an anxiety disorder, but it can keep it under control while the person receives psychotherapy. The principal medications used for anxiety disorders are antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and beta-blockers to control some of the physical symptoms. With proper treatment, many people with anxiety disorders can lead normal, fulfilling lives.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">There is plenty of evidence that exercise can help with anxiety problems. When stress affects the brain, with its many nerve connections, the rest of the body feels the impact as well. Exercise and other physical activity produce endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers. In addition to this, getting physically tired can help people fall asleep faster and have deeper and more relaxing sleep. As many people suffering from anxiety often have problems with insomnia, just the ability to get a good night&rsquo;s rest can change people&rsquo;s whole perspectives.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Anxiety is a normal, but highly subjective, human emotion.

So, there is nothing wrong with anxiety in general, and in fact, we would have difficulties if we did not experience it to some extent, but of course it can get problematic if the danger is one that is imagined rather than real, or the danger is something that is exaggerated. In those cases, particularly if the perceived danger is out of proportion to the real danger, and it is persistent and disabling, then there is a danger of an anxiety disorder.

Scientists are looking at what role genes play in the development of these disorders and are also investigating the effects of environmental factors, such as pollution, physical and psychological stress, and diet. Several parts of the brain are key actors in the production of fear and anxiety.

Often, the therapist will accompany the person to a feared situation to provide support and guidance. Group cognitive behaviour therapy has also been shown to be effective.

In addition to this, getting physically tired can help people fall asleep faster and have deeper and more relaxing sleep.

It&#39;s easy to see why. This glass has five times the strength of standard glass, and when it does break it shatters into tiny cubes rather than large, razor-sharp shards. Architects love it because large panels can be bolted together to make transparent walls, and turning it into ceilings and floors is almost as easy.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">It is made by heating a sheet of ordinary glass to about 620&deg;C to soften it slightly, allowing its structure to expand, and then cooling it rapidly with jets of cold air. This causes the outer layer of the pane to contract and solidify before the interior. When the interior finally solidifies and shrinks, it exerts a pull on the outer layer that leaves It in permanent compression and produces a tensile force inside the glass. As cracks propagate best in materials under tension, the compressive force on the surface must be overcome before the pane will break, making it more resistant to cracking.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The problem starts when glass contains nickel sulphide impurities. Trace amounts of nickel and sulphur are usually present in the raw materials used to make glass, and nickel can also be introduced by fragments of nickel alloys falling into the molten glass. As the glass is heated, these atoms react to&nbsp;form tiny crystals of nickel sulphide. Just a tenth of a gram of nickel in the furnace can create up to 50,000 crystals.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">These crystals can exist in two forms: a dense form called the alpha phase, which is stable at high temperatures, and a less dense form called the beta phase, which is stable at room temperatures. The high temperatures used in the toughening process convert all the crystals to the dense, compact alpha form. But the subsequent cooling is so rapid that the crystals don&#39;t have time to change back to the beta phase. This leaves unstable alpha crystals in the glass, primed like a coiled spring, ready to revert to the beta phase without warning.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">When this happens, the crystals expand by up to 4%. And if they are within the central, tensile region of the pane, the stresses this unleashes can shatter the whole sheet. The time that elapses before failure occurs is unpredictable. It could happen just months after manufacture, or decades later, although if the glass is heated - by sunlight, for example - the process is speeded up. Ironically, says Graham Dodd, of consulting engineers Arup in London, the oldest pane of toughened glass known to have failed due to nickel sulphide inclusions was in Pilkington&#39;s glass research building in Lathom, Lancashire. The pane was 27 years old.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Data showing the scale of the nickel sulphide problem Is almost Impossible to find. The picture is made more complicated by the fact that these crystals occur in batches. So even if, on average, there is only one inclusion in 7 tonnes of glass, if you experience one nickel sulphide failure in your building, that probably means you&#39;ve got a problem in more than one pane. Josie says that in the last decade he has worked on over 15 buildings with the number of failures into double figures.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">One of the worst examples of this is Waterfront Place, which was completed in 1990. Over the following decade the 40- storey Brisbane block suffered a rash of failures. Eighty panes of its toughened glass shattered due to inclusions before experts were finally called in. John Barry, an expert in nickel sulphide contamination at the University of Queensland, analysed every glass pane in the building. Using a studio camera, a photographer went up in a cradle to take photos of every pane. These were scanned under a modified microfiche reader for signs of nickel sulphide crystals. &lsquo;We discovered at least another 120 panes with potentially dangerous inclusions which were then replaced,&rsquo; says Barry. &lsquo;It was a very expensive and time consuming process that took around six months to complete.&#39;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Though the project cost A$1.6 million (nearly &pound;700,000), the alternative - re-cladding the entire building - would have cost ten times as much.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n', '<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Test 2</strong></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">On 2nd August 1999, a particularly hot day in the town of Cirencester in the UK, a large pane of toughened glass in the roof of a shopping centre at Bishops Walk shattered without warning and fell from its frame.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">When fragments were analysed by experts at the giant glass manufacturer Pilkington. which had made the pane, they found that minute crystals of nickel sulphide trapped inside the glass had almost certainly caused the failure.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">\'The glass industry is aware of the issue,\' says Brian Waldron, chairman of the standards committee at tine Glass and Glazing Federation, a British trade association, and standards development officer at Pilkington.

The results of a 14-year study to be announced later this month reveal that the&nbsp;diseases associated with old age are afflicting fewer and fewer people and when they do&nbsp;strike, it is much later in life.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In the last 14 years, the National Long-term Health Care Survey has gathered data on the health and lifestyles of more than 20,000 men and women over 65. Researchers, now&nbsp;analysing the results of data gathered in 1994, say arthritis, high blood pressure and&nbsp;circulation problems - the major medical complaints in this age group - are troubling a&nbsp;smaller proportion every year. And the data confirms that the rate at which these diseases&nbsp;are declining continues to accelerate. Other diseases of old age - dementia, stroke,&nbsp;arteriosclerosis and emphysema - are also troubling fewer and fewer people.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">&#39;It really raises the question of what should be considered normal ageing,&#39; says Kenneth Manton, a demographer from Duke University in North Carolina. He says the problems&nbsp;doctors accepted as normal in a 65-year-old in 1982 are often not appearing until people&nbsp;are 70 or 75.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Clearly, certain diseases are beating a retreat in the face of medical advances. But there may be other contributing factors. Improvements in childhood nutrition in the first quarter of&nbsp;the twentieth century, for example, gave today&#39;s elderly people a better start in life than&nbsp;their predecessors.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">On the downside, the data also reveals failures in public health that have caused surges in some illnesses. An increase in some cancers and bronchitis may reflect changing smoking&nbsp;habits and poorer air quality, say the researchers. &#39;These may be subtle influences,&#39; says&nbsp;Manton, &#39;but our subjects have been exposed to worse and worse pollution for over 60&nbsp;years. It&#39;s not surprising we see some effect.&#39;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">One interesting correlation Manton uncovered is that better-educated people are likely to live longer. For example, 65-year-old women with fewer than eight years of schooling are&nbsp;expected, on average, to live to 82. Those who continued their education live an extra seven&nbsp;years. Although some of this can be attributed to a higher income, Manton believes it is&nbsp;mainly because educated people seek more medical attention.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The survey also assessed how independent people over 65 were, and again found a striking trend. Almost 80% of those in the 1994 survey could complete everyday activities ranging&nbsp;from eating and dressing unaided to complex tasks such as cooking and managing their&nbsp;finances. That represents a significant drop in the number of disabled old people in the&nbsp;population. If the trends apparent in the United States 14 years ago had continued,</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">researchers calculate there would be an additional one million disabled elderly people in today&#39;s population. According to Manton, slowing the trend has saved the United States&nbsp;government&#39;s Medicare system more than $200 billion, suggesting that the greying of&nbsp;America&#39;s population may prove less of a financial burden than expected.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The increasing self-reliance of many elderly people is probably linked to a massive increase in the use of simple home medical aids. For instance, the use of raised toilet seats has more&nbsp;than doubled since the start of the study, and the use of bath seats has grown by more than&nbsp;50%. These developments also bring some health benefits, according to a report from the&nbsp;MacArthur Foundation&#39;s research group on successful ageing.

For example, 65-year-old women with fewer than eight years of schooling are&nbsp;expected, on average, to live to 82. Those who continued their education live an extra seven&nbsp;years.

Why did this particular Big Bang &ndash; the world changing birth of industry &ndash; happen in Britain? And why did it strike at the end of the 18th century?</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">B.</span></span></span></span></b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\"> Macfarlane compares the puzzle to a combination lock. &lsquo;There are about 20 different factors and all of them need to be present before the revolution can happen,&rsquo; he says. For industry to take off, there needs to be the technology and power to drive factories, large urband populations to provide cheap labour, easy transport to move goods around, an affluent middle-class willing to buy mass-produces objects, a market-driven economy and a political system that allows this to happen. While this was the case for England, other nations, such as Japan, the Netherlands and France also met some oss these criteria but were not industrializing. &lsquo;All these factors must have been necessary but not sufficient to cause the revolution,&rsquo; says Macfarlane. &lsquo;After all, Holland had everything except coal, while China also had many of these factors. Most historians are convinced there are one or two missing factors that you need to open the lock.&rsquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">C.</span></span></span></span></b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\"> The missing factors, he proposes, are to be found in almost every kitchen cupboard. Tea and beer two of the nation&rsquo;s favourite drinks, fueled the revolution. the antiseptic properties of tannin, the active ingredient in tea, and of hops in beer &ndash; plus the fact that both are made with boiled water &ndash; allowed urban communities to flourish at close quarters withous succumbing to water-borne diseases such as dysentery. The theory sounds eccentric but once he starts to explain the detective work that went into his deduction, the skepticism gives way to wary admiration. Macfarlane&rsquo;s case has been strengthened by support from notable quarters &ndash; Roy Porter, the distinguished medical historian, recently wrote a favourable appraisal of his research.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span class=\"fontstyle01\" style=\"font-family:Candara,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\">D. </span></span></b></span></span></span></span><span class=\"fontstyle01\" style=\"font-family:Candara,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\">Macfarlane had wondered for a long time how the Industrial Revolution came about. Historians had alighted on one interesting factor around the mid-18th century that required explanation. Between about 1650 and 1740, the population in Britain was static. But then there was a burst in population growth. Macfarlane says: &lsquo;The infant mortality rate halved in the space of 20 years, and this happened in both rural areas and cities, and across all classes. People suggested four possible causes. Was there a sudden change in the viruses and bacteria around? Unlikely. Was there a change in environmental conditions? There were improvements in agriculture that wiped out malaria, but these were small grains. Sanitation did not become widespread until the 19th century. The only option left is food. But the height and weight statistics show a decline. So the food must have got worse. Efforts to explain this sudden reduction in child deaths appeared to draw a blank.&rsquo; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;

Hearing impairment or other auditory function deficit is young children can have a major impact&nbsp;on their development of speech and communication, resulting in a detrimental effect on their &nbsp;ability to learn at school. This is likely to have major consequences for the individual and the&nbsp;population as a whole. The New Zealand Misnistry of Health has found from research carried out&nbsp;over two decades that 6-10% of children in that country are affected by hearing loss.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">B. A preliminary study in New Zealand has shown that classroom noise presents a major concern for&nbsp;teachers and pupils. Modern teaching practices, the organization of desks in the classroom, poor&nbsp;classroom acoustics, and mechanical means of ventilation such as air-conditioning units all&nbsp;contribute to the number of children unable to comprehend the teacher&rsquo;s voice. Education&nbsp;researchers Nelson and Soli have also suggested that recent trends in learning often involve&nbsp;collaborative interaction of multiple minds and tools as much as individual possession of<br />\ninformation. This all amounts to heightened activity and noise levels, which have the potential to&nbsp;be particularly serious for children experiencing auditory function deficit. Noise in classrooms can&nbsp;only exacerbate their difficulty in comprehending and processing verbal communication with&nbsp;other children and instructions from the teacher.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">C. Children with auditory function deficit are potentially failing to learn to their maximum potential&nbsp;because of noise levels generated in classrooms. The effects of noise on the ability of children to&nbsp;learn effectively in typical classroom environments are now the subject of increasing concern. The&nbsp;International Institute of Noise Control Engineering (I-INCE), on the advice of the World Health&nbsp;Organization, has established an international working party, which includes New Zealand, to&nbsp;evaluate noise and reverberation control for school rooms.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">D. While the detrimental effects of noise in classroom situations are not limited to children&nbsp;experiencing disability, those with a disability that affects their processing of speech and verbal&nbsp;communication could be extremely vulnerable. The auditory function deficits in question include&nbsp;hearing impairment, austistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit disorders<br />\n(ADD/ADHD).&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">E. Autism is considered a neurological and genetic life-long disorder that causes discrepancies in the&nbsp;way information is processed. This disorder is characterized by interlinking problems with social imagination, social communication and social ineraction. According to Janzen, this affects the&nbsp;ability to understand and relate in typical ways to people, understand events and objects in the&nbsp;environment, and understand or respond to sensory stimuli. Autism does not allow learning or&nbsp;thinking in the same ways as in children who are developing normally.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><b><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Which section contains the following information?</span></span></span></span></b><br />\n<span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">1.

Two hydraulic steel gatesare raised, so as to seal the gondola&nbsp;off from the water in the canal basin. The water between the gates is then pumped out. A hydraulic&nbsp;clamp, which prevents the arms of the Wheel moving while the gondola is docked, is removed,&nbsp;allowing the Wheel to turn. In the central machine room an array of ten hydraulic motors then begins&nbsp;to rotate the central axle. The axle connects to the outer arms of the Wheel, which begin to rotate at a speed of 1/8 of a revolution per minute. As the wheel rotates, the gondolas are kept in the upright&nbsp;position by a simple gearing system. Two eight-metre-wide cogs orbit a fixed inner cog of the same&nbsp;width, connected by two smaller cogs travelling in the opposite direction to the outer cogs - so&nbsp;ensuring that the gondolas always remain level. When the gondola reaches the top, the boat passes&nbsp;straight onto the aqueduct situated 24 metres above the canal basin.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">The remaining 11 metres of lift needed to reach the Union Canal is achieved by means of a pair of locks. The Wheel could not be constructed to elevate boats over the full 35-metre difference between the two canals, owing to the presence of the historically important Antonine Wall, which was built by the Romans in the second century AD. Boats travel under this wall via a tunnel, then through the locks, and finally on to the Union Canal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><i><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Label the diagram below.

In a paper published last year, biologist Gunter Wagner of Yale University reported some work on the evolutionary history of a group of South American lizards called Bachia. Many of these have minuscule limbs; some look more like snakes than lizards and a few have completely lost the toes on their hind limbs. Other species, however, sport up to four toes on their hind legs. The simplest explanation is that the toed lineages never lost their toes, but Wagner begs to differ. According to his analysis of the Bachia family tree, the toed species re-evolved toes from toeless ancestors and, what is more, digit loss and gain has occurred on more than one occasion over tens of millions of years. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">So what&rsquo;s going on? One possibility is that these traits are lost and then simply reappear, in much the same way that similar structures can independently arise in unrelated species, such as the dorsal fins of sharks and killer whales. Another more intriguing possibility is that the genetic information needed to make toes somehow survived for tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of years in the lizards and was reactivated. These atavistic traits provided an advantage and spread through the population, effectively reversing evolution.<br />\nBut if silent genes degrade within 6 to million years, how can long-lost traits be reactivated over longer timescales? The answer may lie in the womb. Early embryos of many species develop ancestral features. Snake embryos, for example, sprout hind limb buds. Later in development these features disappear thanks to developmental programs that say &lsquo;lose the leg&rsquo;. If for any reason this does not happen, the ancestral feature may not disappear, leading to an atavism. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-size:13pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><i><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:150%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Do the following statements agree with the claims of the writer in Reading Passage 3?
