(1, 1, 'It\'s over', 0, 1, '<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Teresa, I wondered if I could come round to see you. Something&#39;s happened.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">It was eight o&#39;clock on a Monday evening. It wasn&#39;t the best time to telephone a friend with a young child. But this was a crisis and Fanella needed to speak to Teresa urgently.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Of course you can come round,&#39; said Teresa, &#39;if you don&#39;t mind giving Timothy a good night kiss. He&#39;d be furious if he thought you&#39;d been here and he hadn&#39;t seen you.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Fanella smiled, swallowing back tears. She loved Teresa&#39;s little boy, but right now it was going to be difficult to see him. &#39;I&#39;ll be there in about ten minutes,&#39; she said.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Good,&#39; said Teresa. &#39;See you soon then.&#39; Fanella pushed her bike round to the front of her small house. She cycled across Cambridge, avoiding tourists and students as she went, unable to share the happy atmosphere everyone else seemed to be enjoying. The river was alive with boats, the grass full of people picnicking. It was June and the time for end-of-term dances and university ceremonies.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Fanella envied the younger people. They had so few worries. She was trying to fight back the tears that had threatened her all day at work, and were now clouding her eyes as she cycled.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">She rang on Teresa&#39;s smart brass doorbell, parking her bike by the side of the large house.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Come in,&#39; said Teresa, opening the door. Her long brown hair was piled on top of her head, and as usual she was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. &#39;I think Timothy&#39;s still awake, and I promised you&#39;d go up and say good night.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Teresa always talked about her son before anything else. Fanella was used to it. She smiled and went straight up the stairs to the little boy&#39;s bedroom.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Timothy was lying in his bed flying imaginary aeroplanes through the air.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I&#39;ve come to say good night,&#39; said Fanella, sitting down on his bed and thinking how much she liked him.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">He looked so lovable, under the sheets in his clean pyjamas. The curtains were pulled to keep the summer evening light out.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Is Mummy going out?&#39; he asked. Fanella often looked after Timothy when his mother and father went out.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Not tonight.&#39; Fanella smiled. &#39;I&#39;ve come to see your mummy. We&#39;re both here this evening.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Then I&#39;ve got two mummies today,&#39; he said, and Fanella laughed.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I&#39;m not your mummy,&#39; said Fanella. &#39;I&#39;m your special grown-up friend.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Whose mummy are you?&#39; asked Timothy suddenly.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Nobody&#39;s,&#39; said Fanella, afraid the tears would start rolling down her cheeks again.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Why not?&#39; asked Timothy.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Well, not all grown-ups are somebody&#39;s mummy,&#39; began Fanella, feeling this whole subject was too much for her right now. &#39;Some grown-ups choose not to have children, and some grown-ups want to have children, but they can&#39;t.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Do you want to have children?&#39; asked Timothy.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Yes, I do, very much,&#39; said Fanella, thinking how strange it was that Timothy wanted to talk about this today of all days. &#39;Now it&#39;s time you went to sleep, and I&#39;m going to go and talk to your mummy.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Timothy put his arms up and Fanella leant over and kissed him on the cheek. Then he shut his eyes and began to breathe deeply. It was very pleasing, Fanella thought, when a little child trusted you enough to go to sleep in your presence.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">She went down the stairs and into the kitchen where Teresa was putting dishes into the dishwasher. Fanella thought Teresa was so lucky. She had this large beautiful house, a happy marriage and a lovely little boy. But because Teresa was such a good friend, it was difficult to feel envious.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Fanella&#39;s own home was quite different. She loved where it was, in a busy area of the city. There was an Asian grocer&#39;s nearby, selling all kinds of food, and a pub at the end of the road.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">But Fanella&#39;s house was tiny and she and Steven had done all the interior decoration themselves. In contrast to Teresa&#39;s soft shades of cream and natural wood, Fanella and Steven had gone a bit wild and had painted every room a bright colour, according to the mood they wanted to create. And always, in the back of Fanella&#39;s mind, had been the thought that one day, the little second bedroom would become her child&#39;s bedroom - the child she and Steven were going to adopt.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Sit down,&#39; said Teresa, waving a hand at the kitchen table. &#39;What would you like? Tea? Or something stronger?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Tea would be lovely,&#39; said Fanella. &#39;I haven&#39;t had a thing since I got back from work.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Have something to eat,&#39; said Teresa. &#39;There&#39;s some lasagne in the oven. Paulo&#39;s had to work late this evening. He just phoned to say he&#39;d get something to eat on the way home.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;No, thank you,&#39; said Fanella. &#39;I couldn&#39;t eat anything. Just tea, thanks.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;So,&#39; said Teresa sitting down beside her friend, &#39;what&#39;s happened?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Fanella took a deep breath. She wanted to tell Teresa the whole story without crying. But she could only manage two words. &#39;Steven&#39;s left,&#39; she said.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Left?&#39; Teresa was horrified.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Fanella looked at her friend, and nodded. She swallowed hard.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I can&#39;t believe it,&#39; said Teresa. &#39;You two were so much in love. You could see it. Everyone could see it. What do you mean he&#39;s left?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Left,&#39; repeated Fanella. &#39;He&#39;s moved out. He&#39;s gone to live in London. We&#39;ve finished. Broken up. It&#39;s over.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Teresa looked genuinely upset. &#39;What happened? When?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It&#39;s been going on for some time, actually,&#39; said Fanella, feeling relieved now she had told Teresa. &#39;He&#39;s been seeing another woman. I don&#39;t think he really loves her or anything, but we&#39;ve both been under so much stress with trying to adopt a child - I think he just cracked. This other woman was an escape route.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;My goodness!&#39; Teresa sat, not knowing what to say. This really had come as a shock to her. &#39;What... what about the adoption?&#39; she asked, at last.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It looks like that&#39;s out of the question now, doesn&#39;t it?&#39; said Fanella, holding her mug of tea tightly. &#39;The social services make it difficult enough to adopt a child when you&#39;re in a steady relationship. When they witness the relationship fall apart before their eyes, I expect they reject you immediately.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Teresa couldn&#39;t help thinking this was probably true. She tried to think of some words of comfort for her friend, but found it difficult to know what to say. &#39;Fanella,&#39; she sighed at last. &#39;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m truly sorry.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It&#39;s OK,&#39; said Fanella. &#39;I just needed to be with someone this evening.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;When did Steven leave?&#39; asked Teresa.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;This morning. He came back last night from her house and told me he was moving in with her,&#39; Fanella answered. </span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Didn&#39;t he give you any warning at all?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Well, actually I knew about the other woman,&#39; Fanella said. &#39;I&#39;ve known for a few weeks. He started staying in London more and more. I guessed something was going on and I asked him. He said he was trying to stop the affair. I really believed him. He said it was one of those things that was difficult to end because he didn&#39;t want to hurt her. She&#39;s younger. She&#39;s only twenty-one, not ready to settle down or anything, and she doesn&#39;t want children yet. It&#39;s strange because, like me, Steven wanted children so badly. We were so close to getting one.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Teresa looked at her friend and passed her a tissue. She knew all about the pain Fanella had gone through since she discovered she couldn&#39;t have her own children. Steven had been very understanding about it. He had moved in with Fanella and had lived with her for a few years before they decided to try to adopt a child.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Despite the difference in their lives, with Teresa now at home and Fanella still working at the publishers where they had met, the two women had remained close friends. Fanella and Steven had been very involved with Timothy ever since he was born. They had often looked after him, or taken him out at weekends. Fanella was never happier than when she was out with Steven and Timothy, imagining that one day it would be their own child who ran along between them. But now Fanella had to face the fact that the little second bedroom, reserved in her mind for the imaginary child, would probably remain empty forever.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Watching her friend, Teresa wanted to tell Fanella that there were other men out there. A lot of men found Fanella attractive. She was small, with a natural, country-girl face, short dark hair and dark brown eyes. She looked a little tired these days but that was hardly surprising, knowing what she&#39;d been going through.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">However, Teresa knew that Fanella did not want to hear this right now. Finding a man was one thing. Finding a man who was willing to accept that you could never have children, and who would support you through the difficult process of trying to adopt a child, was quite another. Steven had seemed perfect, but even he had weakened under the demands of the situation.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;The truth is,&#39; Fanella went on, &#39;I can bear to live without Steven, I think, once I get used to the idea, but I cannot bear the thought of living without a child.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Timothy is almost your child,&#39; Teresa said, putting her arm round her friend. &#39;He&#39;s always loved you. I sometimes feel he&#39;d rather have you for a mother than me!&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Fanella knew Teresa was trying her best, but it didn&#39;t soften the terrible pain of not having her own child.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I must go,&#39; said Fanella, hearing Paulo&#39;s key in the lock. She didn&#39;t want to spoil the little bit of evening Teresa and her husband had left together. &#39;Thanks for listening. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I just wish I could help,&#39; said Teresa sadly. &#39;Please come round any time you feel like it.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">As she watched Fanella cycle into the dusk, Teresa felt a little guilty at her own good fortune.</span></span></p>', 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0Byg9SrtGqyARVEp0MGNtc0RBY28&authuser=0', 1, '2017-09-14 16:05:49', '2017-09-14 16:05:49'),

It was a Tuesday morning in September. The first day back at school after the long summer break.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">He rolled over and looked at his beautiful wife. He admired her as she lay, still half asleep, on the white sheets beside him. It would be nice to stay in bed and spend the morning with her. But he had to be at school in time to prepare the day, before the children arrived at nine o&#39;clock.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">He rolled out of bed unwillingly and showered. Then, after pulling on the clothes he had put out the night before, he went down to the kitchen to make coffee. He would take Leah some coffee before he left, envying her being able to stay in bed in the mornings. She worked as a freelance interior designer and, unless she had an appointment somewhere, did not have to travel to work. She had a studio in the garage and operated her business from there.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod, on the other hand, had a forty-five-minute drive to the school in Cambridge where he worked. It was often a slow journey. The traffic seemed to get worse every day. But he and Leah loved their home in the country and, since he liked his job so much, the only option was to commute.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I&#39;ll see you this evening,&#39; he said, kissing his wife. She opened her eyes and smiled warmly.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;OK, have a good day,&#39; she said, as she turned over and went quickly back to sleep.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">An hour later, Rod was in his classroom and the children were arriving. You couldn&#39;t sit around for an hour in this job, catching up on phone calls, as you could in an office, Rod supposed. Children needed you then and there, and if you weren&#39;t prepared, the day could quickly turn into chaos.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Morning, Rod.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Hi, Teresa. Hello, Timothy.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod was Timothy&#39;s teacher, and Teresa was pleased. Rod was a good teacher and Timothy loved him. Rod was glad to have the little boy in his class and he liked Teresa; she was always friendly, and only ever had praise for the work he did.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Other parents were much more difficult. There was one mother who complained every morning about how her &#39;perfect little son&#39;, was being criticised by teachers and children alike. She could never see that her son might be to blame for anything. She even seemed to encourage him to start fights!</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod could see this mother coming now, and tried to avoid her by capturing Teresa&#39;s attention. &#39;There&#39;s something you might be able to help me with,&#39; he said to her. &#39;I want to invite someone in to talk about writing or illustrating children&#39;s books, or publishing them maybe. I thought it would be interesting for the children. I remember you used to work in publishing.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Ah,&#39; said Teresa. &#39;I know just the person.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Good,&#39; said Rod. &#39;Tell me more.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It&#39;s a friend of mine,&#39; Teresa said. &#39;She&#39;s an editor for children&#39;s books and has a lot of contact with authors and illustrators. But, more importantly, she knows about the whole publishing process... and she loves children. I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be delighted to come in and give a talk.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Do you want to ask her first?&#39; said Rod. &#39;If she&#39;s keen, she could telephone me at school.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;OK. That sounds like a good idea,&#39; said Teresa, kissing Timothy goodbye. &#39;She might be too busy of course, but I&#39;ll certainly ask her.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Thanks,&#39; said Rod, smiling at her. &#39;Right,&#39; he said turning to the class. &#39;Time to start the lesson.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">But the mother he had been trying to avoid was waiting for him. &#39;I want to talk to you about my Dan,&#39; she said, ignoring the fact that Rod was trying to calm down thirty children. &#39;Dan told me that last term a boy called Timothy kicked him.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Last term?&#39; Rod echoed. &#39;I really think that anything that happened over six weeks ago can be forgotten. We all want to make a new start at the beginning of the term, don&#39;t we?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;There you go again. You teachers always have your favourites, while children like my Dan get blamed for everything,&#39; the mother said.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I&#39;m not blaming Dan for anything,&#39; said Rod sighing, and wishing the woman would go. &#39;I just want to start the new term off on a positive note. I&#39;ll keep a careful eye on the two boys today, and let you know if there&#39;s any trouble.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod doubted that Timothy, who was such a quiet child, would have kicked Dan, who looked like a prizewinning boxer.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;You teachers. You just can&#39;t be bothered to do your jobs properly,&#39; said the woman insultingly. &#39;I&#39;ll be asking my Dan at the end of the day what happened, so you&#39;d better keep your word.&#39; She turned and left then, and Rod breathed a sigh of relief.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod enjoyed his job, and in contrast to the woman&#39;s accusations, he tried very hard to treat all the children fairly. But his job was made much more difficult when parents did not support him, and it always felt good when they did.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">By lunchtime, he was already exhausted. One child had been sick, and had been sent home. Dan had got into trouble in the break for stealing another child&#39;s apple, then throwing it over the school fence. Rod had had to send Dan to the headteacher. Rod was sure Dan&#39;s mother would hear about the incident and would soon be back to complain.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I need another holiday after this morning,&#39; he joked to the other teachers in the staffroom. Several of them looked at him pityingly. Rod was the only male teacher and some of the women clearly didn&#39;t think he was able to teach six-year-olds as well as they could. One or two of them also thought that because he had no children of his own, he was even less qualified for the job.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It&#39;s men, you see,&#39; joked one of them now. &#39;You&#39;re just not up to it.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod ignored her and went back to his classroom to prepare for the afternoon.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">By three o&#39;clock, as he read the class their afternoon story, they seemed much more settled. Looking at their small interested faces, he remembered what it was about the job he loved. However difficult they sometimes appeared, however awful their parents were, there was always some little ray of light in every child. Rod smiled to himself when he noticed that tough little Dan had his thumb in his mouth, as he listened to the story. Even Dan could be soft and sweet when he was tired and caught up in a good story, thought Rod.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod drove home, feeling the weight of the day lift from him as he left the city and set off across open country. His and Leah&#39;s home had been two cottages which they had made into one. With its views over open countryside and its stone floors and open fireplaces, it looked like something from a magazine. Leah had painted the walls white, stripped the paint off the wood and made her own curtains. Her antiques were carefully placed around the house, and everyone who came there admired it.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod liked the house too, but sometimes he couldn&#39;t help feeling it was maybe too elegant, too unlived in. He would be quite happy with a little more mess about the place. Leah placed high value on how things looked and for her the home was more important than anything. It was one of the reasons she didn&#39;t want children. She thought they would just mess it up and break her precious antiques.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">But it certainly was a peaceful place after a long noisy day in the classroom. Rod pulled his shoes off and placed them carefully by the door. He walked across the stone floor in the kitchen to the drinks cupboard and poured himself a beer.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Good day?&#39; Leah appeared in the doorway, her blonde hair slightly untidy from bending over the drawings on her desk.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Really busy,&#39; said Rod. &#39;How was yours?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;Great,&#39; said Leah. &#39;I&#39;ve been asked to redecorate the Simpsons&#39; farmhouse up the hill. It&#39;s a big job and they&#39;ll pay well.&#39; </span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">She smiled. She loved her work and was beginning to get a name for herself in the world of interior design.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Rod admired her, and thought how different her days were to his. His day had involved dealing with a fight, a sick child, an anxious parent and a stressed headteacher, as well as trying to teach a group of children with hugely varying abilities. Meanwhile, his wife had done some drawings, visited a smart farmhouse and sat at her desk in the peace and quiet, looking beautiful. If he didn&#39;t love his job so much, he might envy her.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;I&#39;ve made supper,&#39; said Leah, opening the oven door and letting a delicious smell float into the air.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">Still, thought Rod, as he sat back on the sofa, there was nothing nicer than coming home to a wife who enjoyed her job, and managed to cook a nice meal at the same time.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It smells delicious,&#39; he said, pulling Leah down onto the sofa next to him. &#39;Mmm, and so do you. What perfume are you wearing?&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;It&#39;s Chanel,&#39; said Leah. &#39;A little treat for myself for getting that contract.&#39;</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"text\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 6pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman CYR&quot;,serif\">&#39;You deserve it,&#39; said Rod, wondering when she&#39;d had time to go into town and buy herself perfume. He was also feeling annoyed with himself - he wished he&#39;d thought of buying it for her.</span></span></p>', 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0Byg9SrtGqyARZURYWlJiMzJiRUU&authuser=0', 1, '2017-09-14 16:12:26', '2017-09-14 16:12:26');
